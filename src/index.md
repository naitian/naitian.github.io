I'm a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, where I'm advised
by David Bamman and supported by the NSF graduate research fellowship.

My research centers on developing computational methods to understand meaning
embedded in style. This draws on a variationist sociolinguistic / cultural
anthropological perspective of culture, and spans the fields of NLP,
computational social science, and cultural analytics. Methodologically, I am
interested in multimodal approaches to language, vision and speech. I also care
a lot about the news, data journalism, data visualization and crossword puzzles.

If you are interested in doing research or grad school, I am always happy to
chat about my experiences. If you are a Berkeley undergrad interested in doing
cultural analytics research, you should apply for a [UROP
opportunity](https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/application/) with my advisor,
David Bamman.

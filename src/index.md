I'm a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, where I'm advised
by David Bamman.

I'm interested in some mixture of computational social science, natural language
processing and digital humanities. I also care a lot about the news, data
journalism, data visualization and crossword puzzles.

<span class="l1">I'm a recent alum of the University of Michigan (<span
style="color: #00274C">go blue!</span>)</span><span class="l2">, where I
studied computer science, data science and linguistics.</span> There, I
worked with [David Jurgens](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu) in the UM
School of Information. In the past, I've worked on social computing with
[Tanu Mitra](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/) in the UW Information
School and on social dialogue agents with [Jon
May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) at USC ISI.

## It's been a minute.

I recently received a kind email from a reader who asked me how things are
going.
This was a pleasant reminder that others actually read my writing, and a less
pleasant reminder that it _has_ been a while since I've posted on this blog.


This hiatus hasn't been due to a lack of inspiration; in fact, there's been a
lot on my mind recently about grad school, my research, and what it means to
"study culture" empirically. I have wanted to write about all of these things.
So what gives?

I think, since starting my PhD, my relationship to writing has changed a bit. In
the past, I assigned very little stakes to the writing that I put out (in fact,
this wasn't really something that I thought about.)
But now I feel much more ownership of my words and ideas and, with that
ownership, a greater pressure to only share the good ones.

Perhaps I am placing too much value on this blog, but I would like to use this
platform to discuss ideas that I find meaningful. To an extent, I think this
_does_ warrant a deeper, more critical level of engagement with what I am
writing.

On the other hand, when I've started drafting posts, I've found myself paralyzed
by indecision or talking myself into knots. I am compelled to endlessly
explicate, constantly contextualize; I find myself exhausted, paragraphs deep,
and no closer to making my point. I need to make my peace with the fact that
discourse is ambiguous, messy, and interpretive. I can't expect to fit an entire
discourse into a single turn, so I need to just put my thoughts out there and
start talking.

I've recently begun reading _The Archaeology of Knowledge_. At the end of the
introduction, Foucault talks about writing with uncertainty:

> What, do you imagine that I would take so much trouble and so much pleasure
> in writing, do you think that I would keep so persistently to my task, if I were
> not preparing – with a rather shaky hand – a labyrinth into which I can venture,
> in which I can move my discourse, opening up underground passages, forcing it to
> go far from itself, finding overhangs that reduce and deform its itinerary, in
> which I can lose myself and appear at last to eyes that I will never have to
> meet again.

And so too shall I proceed, hands shaky, into the labyrinth.

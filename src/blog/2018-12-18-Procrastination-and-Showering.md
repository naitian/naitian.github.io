## Procrastination

I have a final in just over two hours. In fact, it's the last final
of my first semester. The final final, so to speak.

And like the model student I am, I'm not studying right now. Instead,
I'm writing an entry for a blog that probably only I read.

But whatever. Here's a quick tip I've picked up.

## Showering

Yes, that is indeed something one should do at college. But there's more.
I've discovered, the time spent under the shower head is a great time to
do math homework!

On multiple occasions, I've figured out a problem or a proof while being
pummeled by particles of water. I think it has something to do with the
white noise of water and not having any distractions.

Here are a couple of ways to set yourself up for success in seeking your
shower-solution:

1. You should definitely attempt the problem before showering. You should
    know the problem inside and out before you try to throw suds at the
    solution.
2. Don't shower immediately after attempting the problem. I like to sleep
    on it, so try it the night before, then shower in the morning.
3. A good way to know if you will find success in the shower is if you
    feel like you're incredibly close to the answer, but you're missing
    one key insight, or your mental processes are clouded by the fact
    that you've been working on it for so long.

One pitfall of this technique, of course, is the inexplicable lack of
accessible showers in the exam setting. But you win some and you lose some,
I guess.

Best of luck to you in your hot-shower homework endeavours. I need to go
cram for a final now.

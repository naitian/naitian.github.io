## Organizing My Thoughts
I'm writing this blog post on New Year's Day, bracing myself for the violent
reentry into my hectic school life in less than 2 days. I think this is a good
opportunity for me to take a step back and organize my thoughts while I still
have the time (and patience), so here goes.

## Table of Contents

## This Website
I've spent the majority of my winter break working on this website. It's built
with blood, sweat, and tears, except instead of blood I used Jekyll, and instead
of sweat and tears I used Sass and HTML.

This was also my first time working with Sass, so definitely expect something
about that experience soon. In fact, I didn't expect to be using Sass, until my
hand was basically forced when I wanted to use any type of asset pipeline for
minimizing and optimizing my assets.

There's still lots of work to be done, particularly in the little "terminal"
easter egg on the home page, but I'm very happy with the site.

## This Blog
After finishing the first version of the blog sometime in May of <strike>this
year</strike> last year, I uploaded my first post (about Chrome Dev Tools), and
then promptly ignored it for the rest of the year. I definitely plan on posting
more, and hopefully at least once every week, with either tidbits of my personal
life or technical advice.

## This Life (Mine, Not Yours)
I expect that, once I enter the halls of Thomas Jefferson High School for
Science and Technology, I will once again be faced with the challenges of
balancing schoolwork with everything else that I want to do, including Dev Club,
this blog, band, and so much more. So how do I plan on staying afloat? If only I
knew. That said, I'll take to heart Dory's advice of "Just keep swimming", and
keep you guys updated.

Anyway, Happy New Year's, and I hope you're as excited as I am (despite my
moaning and groaning) to start this year off strong.

## Introduction

I spent the better part of my winter break revamping my personal website (of
which this blog is a component). You can view the old site here:
[naitian.github.io](https://naitian.github.io).

If you want to skip to another part of this walkthrough, I have links to all of
the available parts listed for you here:

## Setting Goals

I think it's important to consider what the goals, desires, and requirements are
for every project.

While I was generally satisfied with the old website, there were some issues that I felt
needed addressing.

   - The overabundance of colors pulled from
       [flatuicolors.com](http://flatuicolors.com) was busy, and seemed like it
       wasn't well thought out.
   - The terminal in the background never worked very well, and ultimately
       didn't do everything I wanted it to. **I wanted a dynamic "terminal" through
       which you could basically browse the entire website**.
   - I had gotten tired of the one-page layout, after also using for the [Dev
       Club Website](https://tjdev.club), so **I wanted to challenge myself with a
       new type of layout**.
   - I wanted to start up the blog again, and the original Jekyll blog was kind
       of a pain to work with. **I wanted to minimize the friction involved with
       publishing new posts**, which would in turn encourage me to write more.

Okay, so those were the things that I took issue with. However, there were some
aspects of the site that I wanted to keep.

   - I liked the terminal; it's fun and nerdy. So I wanted to keep it, but maybe
       make it a bit more subtle.
   - I liked having distinct colors for the different sections.

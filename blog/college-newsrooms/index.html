    <h1 class="title">So you want to build a high tech col­lege news­room</h1>
    <section><h2></h2><p>College news­rooms have tra­di­tion­ally been the launch­pad for many suc­cess­ful
jour­nal­ism ca­reers. They pro­vide a lower-stakes en­vi­ron­ment for as­pir­ing
jour­nal­ists to hone their skills, gain an un­der­stand­ing of the in­dus­try and
make con­nec­tions.</p><p>In re­cent years, ma­jor na­tional news­rooms like the New York Times and The
Washington Post have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2020/12/09/washington-post-expands-investment-emerging-storytelling-technology-with-new-lede-lab/">ramped up their tech
ef­forts</a>
to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/index.html">re­vi­tal­ize their dig­i­tal
prod­ucts</a>, and there
are <a href="https://newspack.pub/">many</a> <a href="https://source.opennews.org/">ini­tia­tives</a>
to help smaller news­rooms keep up with this tech­no­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion within the
in­dus­try as well.
But de­spite the grow­ing im­por­tance of news­room en­gi­neers, data jour­nal­ists and
graph­ics de­vel­op­ers, many col­lege news­rooms don’t of­fer a space for stu­dents
with these ca­reer as­pi­ra­tions.</p><!-- However, this success is rarely replicated when it comes to technology in the --><!-- newsroom[^1]. --><!----><p>A tra­di­tional com­puter sci­ence back­ground is also in­suf­fi­cient for the as­pir­ing
news­room tech­nol­o­gist<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Note: there is a huge vari­ance in the types of roles en­com­passed by<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>newsroom tech”: any­thing from us­ing data sci­ence in ser­vice of re­port­ing to build­ing news­room tools to de­vel­op­ing web apps and graph­ics.</span>. While more tra­di­tional soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing
po­si­tions ex­ist within the news­room, many roles (like graph­ics or data
re­port­ing) have <a href="https://twitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1339569158506352642?s=20&#x26;t=LKJ3dYX3P2agnHQqPLWJoA">dif­fer­ent work­flows with dif­fer­ent time­lines and
ex­pec­ta­tions</a>
compared to the typ­i­cal soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing job. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, the hir­ing
process also dif­fers from tra­di­tional soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing com­pa­nies. There
seems to be a greater em­pha­sis on ex­plain­ing your prior work, as op­posed to the
Leet­Code-heavy re­cruit­ing process in big tech com­pa­nies. Finally, news­room
hir­ing ef­forts are dwarfed by Big Tech, to the point where many stu­dents are
likely un­aware of news­room en­gi­neer­ing as a vi­able ca­reer path at all.</p><p>Over the past three years, as a stu­dent at the University of Michigan (a
university with­out a j-school!), I’ve been work­ing along­side other
ex­tra­or­di­nar­ily tal­ented stu­dents to turn The Michigan Daily into a high tech
news­room: one which pre­pares stu­dents for the code-heavy news­rooms of the
fu­ture.</p></section>
<section><h2>Step 1: Sell the vi­sion</h2><p>In the best case, your col­lege news­room is the <a href="https://graphicsdesk.github.io/">Columbia
Spectator</a>. In the worst case, your col­lege
news­room views tech­nol­ogy as a per­ver­sion of the sacro­sanct art of jour­nal­ism.
More likely than not, though, your news­room is to­tally un­aware of the ex­cit­ing
pos­si­bil­ity of news­room tech (or they have dis­missed it as be­yond the
ca­pa­bil­i­ties of a col­lege pa­per). In any case, you need to make a strong pitch.</p><p>A col­lege news­room has two mis­sions: 1) de­liver qual­ity jour­nal­ism and 2)
develop as­pir­ing jour­nal­ists. Here are some brief talk­ing points that ad­dress
both:</p><ol>
<li>Data analy­sis and sta­tis­tics skills are im­por­tant to un­cover in­ter­est­ing
sto­ries (journalism), pro­vide a new an­gle (journalism) or even just crit­i­cally eval­u­ate
the truth­ful­ness of cer­tain claims (pedagogy).</li>
<li>The dig­i­tal medium opens up many sto­ry­telling pos­si­bil­i­ties that in­crease
en­gage­ment (journalism) while also al­low­ing stu­dents to rapidly ex­per­i­ment with
new tech­nolo­gies (pedagogy).</li>
<li>In fact, all this is so true that ma­jor na­tional news­rooms have be­gun do­ing
this years ago!</li>
</ol><p>At The Daily, we were for­tu­nate to al­ready have a web team when I first joined.
How­ever, it was poorly in­te­grated and had lit­tle buy-in from the rest of the
news­room. This means pro­jects would fre­quently fail to see the light of day.
This un­der­scores the im­por­tance of (first) get­ting the rest of the news­room
ex­cited about your web team and (second) build­ing out the processes and
work­flows to get pro­jects out the door.</p></section>
<section><h2>Step 2: Set up a struc­ture</h2><p>It turns out, col­lege news­rooms work be­cause they’ve had decades<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dartmouth">if not cen­turies</a>!</span> to fig­ure
out how to op­er­ate. This in­cludes processes like how to pitch a story, how to
train new hires, how to col­lab­o­rate be­tween sec­tions,
etc. You likely have four years at most to build out these processes for what
might be a brand new<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>web team”, so you bet­ter get crack­ing!</p><p>The first step is to fig­ure out how tech fits into your news­room. At The Daily,
we have a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>web team”, which falls into the org chart as an­other sec­tion
along­side News and Sports and oth­ers. You may want to sep­a­rate out fur­ther,
since peo­ple work­ing on news­room tools don’t pro­duce con­tent. Or you may want
to in­te­grate more tightly, since your graph­ics de­vel­op­ers or data jour­nal­ists
need to work with other sec­tions to get sto­ries out the door. Or both. Newsroom
tech is a big um­brella, with dif­fer­ent time­lines and ex­pec­ta­tions for dif­fer­ent
types of work.</p><p>You also need to de­ter­mine what roles you want to fill. Since there is so much
va­ri­ety in the type of soft­ware you can write in a news­room, you might want to
fo­cus on de­vel­op­ing a sub­set of skills at the on­set. At The Daily, we put a lot
of ef­fort ini­tially into de­vel­op­ing our data graph­ics sub­team. This in­creased
our pres­ence in the news­room, pro­duced some tan­gi­ble out­puts and gave us the
lee­way to ex­pand into other ar­eas (like mo­bile app de­vel­op­ment and web
pro­jects).</p><p>Your web team does­n’t ex­ist in a vac­uum, and you need to fig­ure out how to
in­te­grate with the news­room; what re­spon­si­bil­i­ties will you take on? How will
this af­fect the work that other sec­tions do? For ex­am­ple, you might want to
have a chat with the de­sign sec­tion about how your graph­ics de­vel­op­ers will fit
into the cur­rent work­flow and what changes might be nec­es­sary. How will you
pro­duce sto­ries? Will your data team be work­ing with re­porters from other
sec­tions or pitch­ing their own sto­ries (or both)?</p><p>After you make these de­ci­sions, you need to com­mu­ni­cate it all to the rest of
the news­room. Make sure other sec­tions are aware of the work you’re ca­pa­ble of
do­ing, the work you’d like to take on and how that aligns with the work they
do.</p></section>
<section><h2>Step 3: Develop your team</h2><p>While most col­lege stu­dents have at least some amount of writ­ing ex­pe­ri­ence by
the time they end up in the news­room, that’s much less likely to be the case
when it comes to soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing. The floor to en­try is much higher, since
there’s a lot of pre­req­ui­site knowl­edge to start pro­duc­ing con­tent. The big
chal­lenge is to pro­vide the min­i­mal amount of train­ing for stu­dents to start
con­tribut­ing to pro­jects, while as­sum­ing min­i­mal prior ex­pe­ri­ence.</p><p>Again, the ped­a­gog­i­cal value comes mainly from ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing. That
means your train­ing should­n’t re­sem­ble or re­place course­work (after all,
every­one is al­ready in col­lege to take courses). Offer sup­port and ex­per­tise to
give stu­dents their great­est chance of suc­cess (publishing any­thing is bet­ter
than noth­ing), but also pro­vide the room to ex­per­i­ment and fail.</p><p>This is some­thing we are in the process of con­stantly re­fin­ing at The Daily.
The biggest pri­or­ity for se­nior lead­er­ship is de­vel­op­ing a cul­ture for newer
mem­bers to learn and flour­ish.</p></section>
<section><h2>Step 4: Enculturation</h2><p>Just as your web team does­n’t ex­ist in a vac­uum, nei­ther does your news­room.
Try to ex­pose your team (and your­self) to the sur­round­ing com­mu­nity of col­lege
and pro­fes­sional news­rooms. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>news nerd” com­mu­nity of
news­room tech­nol­o­gists has been in­cred­i­bly open and gen­er­ous with knowl­edge.</p><p>Learn about the processes and work­flows other or­ga­ni­za­tions use, as well as the
tools and tech­nolo­gies they em­ploy. See what sto­ries other or­ga­ni­za­tions are
pro­duc­ing, and how they are ex­e­cut­ing their vi­sion. This all feeds into
in­spi­ra­tion for <em>your</em> news­room’s next big pro­ject.</p><p>Impress upon your team the pos­si­bil­ity of work­ing in the news­room. Make them
aware of var­i­ous news­room in­tern­ships for the sum­mer or dur­ing the school year.
En­cour­age them to ap­ply! This gives great in­sight into how pro­fes­sional
news­rooms op­er­ate and helps build valu­able con­nec­tions as you ad­vance your
ca­reer.</p><p>The most im­por­tant thing you can do to guar­an­tee the suc­cess of your high tech
news­room is to in­grain an in­clu­sive, pro­duc­tive cul­ture. Get your old mem­bers
to teach your new mem­bers, and get your new mem­bers to come back year af­ter
year.</p></section>
<section><h2>Step 5: Profit!</h2><p>There you go. You did it. Your col­lege news­room now has an amaz­ing team of
soft­ware en­gi­neers and data jour­nal­ists and graph­ics de­vel­op­ers and UI/UX
designers work­ing on a half dozen dif­fer­ent pro­jects for the news­room.
Re­mem­ber: it did­n’t start like this. It started with just a hand­ful of peo­ple
(or maybe even just you) who were ex­cited about the idea of work­ing where tech
and jour­nal­ism in­ter­sect.</p><p>And it does­n’t end like this ei­ther: The Michigan Daily web team is still
grow­ing and evolv­ing to bet­ter serve the news­room and bet­ter serve our
stu­dents. I can only hope that I helped The Daily take those first steps&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and
I hope you might be in­spired to take them, too.</p></section>

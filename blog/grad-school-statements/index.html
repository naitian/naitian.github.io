    <h1 class="title">My grad school state­ments</h1>
    <section><h2></h2><p>It’s around that time of year again when peo­ple are be­gin­ning to the grad school
ap­pli­ca­tion process. I found it very use­ful to read the state­ments of pre­vi­ous
ap­pli­cants when I was writ­ing my state­ments, so I’m mak­ing my own ap­pli­ca­tion
ma­te­ri­als avail­able as a re­source for fu­ture ap­pli­cants.</p><p>All schools re­quire a state­ment of pur­pose, which ex­plains your spe­cific
re­search in­ter­ests. Some also re­quire a per­sonal state­ment, which is a bit less
de­fined / less con­sis­tent in de­f­i­n­i­tion across schools, but gen­er­ally pro­vides
an op­por­tu­nity to speak to your per­sonal back­ground and mo­ti­va­tions for grad­u­ate
school. You can find what I sub­mit­ted to Berkeley here:</p><ul>

<section><h2>Notes</h2><p>I hope to some­day write more about the process of draft­ing and re­vis­ing my
state­ments, but for now I’ll just pro­vide an overview of what the time­line
looked like for me, as well as some mis­cel­la­neous notes about the writ­ing
process. The ma­jor­ity of my ef­forts were ded­i­cated to the state­ment of pur­pose,
so I’ll fo­cus on that.</p><p>I wrote three main drafts over the course of about a month. The first draft</p><!-- I began my first draft of my statement of purpose on November 5th at 9PM. I
finished that draft at 5:30PM the next day (over the course of several shorter
writing sessions.) I finished my final revisions at 3:30PM on November 30th, so
the whole process took a bit less than a month -- so you have plenty of time
still!

However, it's important to note that I had already applied to the NSF Graduate
Research Fellowship in October, so I'd already had to draft similar documents
for that application. If you are eligible, I highly recommend that you apply to
fellowships -- these are not only helpful for admissions in the event that you
win them, but they are also useful as a forcing function to think about how you
want to present yourself and your research interests early.

I began drafting the statement by writing down my research interests, then added  --></section>

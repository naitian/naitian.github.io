    <h1 class="title">Shaky writ­ing</h1>
    <section><h2>It’s been a minute.</h2><p>I re­cently re­ceived a kind email from a reader who asked me how things are
go­ing.
This was a pleas­ant re­minder that oth­ers ac­tu­ally read my writ­ing, and a less
pleas­ant re­minder that it <em>has</em> been a while since I’ve posted on this blog.</p><p>This hia­tus has­n’t been due to a lack of in­spi­ra­tion; in fact, there’s been a
lot on my mind re­cently about grad school, my re­search, and what it means to
“study cul­ture” em­pir­i­cally. I have wanted to write about all of these things.
So what gives?</p><p>I think, since start­ing my PhD, my re­la­tion­ship to writ­ing has changed a bit. In
the past, I as­signed very lit­tle stakes to the writ­ing that I put out (in fact,
this was­n’t re­ally some­thing that I thought about.)
But now I feel much more own­er­ship of my words and ideas and, with that
own­er­ship, a greater pres­sure to only share the good ones.</p><p>Perhaps I am plac­ing too much value on this blog, but I would like to use this
plat­form to dis­cuss ideas that I find mean­ing­ful. To an ex­tent, I think this
<em>does</em> war­rant a deeper, more crit­i­cal level of en­gage­ment with what I am
writ­ing.</p><p>On the other hand, when I’ve started draft­ing posts, I’ve found my­self par­a­lyzed
by in­de­ci­sion or talk­ing my­self into knots. I am com­pelled to end­lessly
ex­pli­cate, con­stantly con­tex­tu­al­ize; I find my­self ex­hausted, para­graphs deep,
and no closer to mak­ing my point. I need to make my peace with the fact that
dis­course is am­bigu­ous, messy, and in­ter­pre­tive. I can’t ex­pect to fit an en­tire
dis­course into a sin­gle turn, so I need to just put my thoughts out there and
start talk­ing.</p><p>I’ve re­cently be­gun read­ing <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>. At the end of the
in­tro­duc­tion, Foucault talks about writ­ing with un­cer­tainty:</p><blockquote>
<p>What, do you imag­ine that I would take so much trou­ble and so much plea­sure
in writ­ing, do you think that I would keep so per­sis­tently to my task, if I were
not prepar­ing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;with a rather shaky hand&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a labyrinth into which I can ven­ture,
in which I can move my dis­course, open­ing up un­der­ground pas­sages, forc­ing it to
go far from it­self, find­ing over­hangs that re­duce and de­form its itin­er­ary, in
which I can lose my­self and ap­pear at last to eyes that I will never have to
meet again.</p>
</blockquote><p>And so too shall I pro­ceed, hands shaky, into the labyrinth.</p></section>

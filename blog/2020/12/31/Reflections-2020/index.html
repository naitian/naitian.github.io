<section><h2>Highlights</h2><p>This will be dif­fi­cult be­cause it feels like time did­n’t re­ally ex­ist be­fore
March, but I’ll try any­way.</p><p>In <strong>January</strong>, the Michigan Union held its grand open­ing be­fore shut­ting back
down due to Covid just three months later. We kicked off a new se­mes­ter of
Michi­gan Data Science Team with a new set of work­shops tar­geted for be­gin­ners. I
read <em>The Signal and the Noise</em> by Nate Silver. Finally, af­ter talk­ing to my
room­mate Parth, I de­cided to join the data team at the Michigan Daily.</p><p><strong>February</strong> was short but still plenty event­ful. I started work­ing on my <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/government/can-money-buy-votes-how-financial-contributions-michigan-could-impact-primaries">first
analy­sis for the
Daily</a>,
read <em>Fortune Cookie Chronicles</em> by Jennifer 8. Lee, and went axe throw­ing with
MDST. On the last (leap) day, I landed in Boston to visit my friend Nina at
Har­vard.</p><p>This leads into <strong>March</strong>, where I wrapped up my spring break with what in
hind­sight was prob­a­bly an ill-ad­vised tour down the east coast. I wrapped up
Boston by get­ting a li­brary card from Boston Public Library (absolutely
beautiful), vis­itng the Isabella Stewart Gardner mu­seum, get­ting Chinese food
and desserts from Chinatown, and see­ing the ducks in Boston com­mons. After a
har­row­ing sprint to South Station, I made it to New York, where I had more
Chi­nese food, at­tended a com­edy show at my hos­tel, and vis­ited the New York
Times build­ing, the Highline, the Chinese American History Museum, the New York
Public Library (also very pretty), Hadestown on Broadway, the MoMA, and then
sprinted to Penn Station to catch an Amtrak to <span class="small-caps">DC</span>. From <span class="small-caps">DC</span>, I con­tin­ued to
Pitts­burgh, catch­ing up with friends at <span class="small-caps">CMU</span> and Pitt, be­fore dri­ving back up to
Ann Arbor. All this took place over the first week of March, af­ter which
every­thing de­scended into chaos: we had pri­maries cov­er­age for the Daily,
immediately af­ter which Michigan shut down for Covid. March ends with mak­ing a
pre­ma­ture de­par­ture from cam­pus.</p><p>After a <em>very</em> event­ful March, <strong>April</strong> was bor­ing by com­par­i­son, marked
mostly by on­line classes and ex­ams as the se­mes­ter wrapped up.</p><p><strong>May</strong> was mostly en­joy­ing my sum­mer va­ca­tion be­fore school be­gan and
fi­nal­iz­ing my pa­per for <span class="small-caps">EMNLP</span>. I also re­solved to sew my­self a back­pack as a
sum­mer pro­ject only to dis­cover all the sewing ma­chines were out of stock! I
started my re­search in­tern­ship at <span class="small-caps">USC</span> af­ter Labor day. Finally, I watched as
SpaceX launched the first as­tro­nauts into space from the <span class="small-caps">US</span> in close to a
decade. An early in­ter­est in rock­ets and space re­ally pro­pelled me onto a STEM
track, and this was a re­minder of what had in­spired me so many years be­fore.</p><p>In <strong>June</strong>, I fi­nally man­aged to buy a sewing ma­chine (but no ma­te­ri­als yet). I
was in­tro­duced to cross­word puz­zles and pro­ceeded to <del>waste</del> spend a few hours
every day on cross­words&hellip;</p><p><strong>July</strong> is when my back­pack­ing plans went into full force as I fi­nally re­ceived
my sup­plies. Plenty of mis­takes were made, and I had to dis­as­sem­ble and re­pair
the sewing ma­chine more than once.</p><p>I fi­nally, in a mad dash over three days, fin­ished my back­pack in <strong>August</strong>.
This was just in time to move back onto cam­pus, where I would pro­ceed to take
all my classes from my room and leave the back­pack sit­ting de­ject­edly in a
cor­ner. I also made some fan­tas­tic pro­duc­tiv­ity pur­chases: a nice chair from
Ikea and a stand­ing desk (amazing).</p><p>In <strong>September</strong>, I started at <span class="small-caps">NBC</span> News and cov­ered the first pres­i­den­tial
de­bate my sec­ond week of work. It was an ex­hil­a­rat­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for some­one
to­tally new to the news scene as we worked to de­bug our vis lit­er­ally up un­til
the minute the de­bate be­gan. I re­ceived no­tice that my pa­per was ac­cepted to
EMNLP. I also deep-fried food for the first time and it was a re­sound­ing
suc­cess. Finally, I bought a cross­word sub­scrip­tion, much to the detri­ment of my
pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p><p><strong>October</strong> was dom­i­nated by cov­er­ing Presidential de­bates (the ones that
weren’t can­celled, at least), prep­ping for <span class="small-caps">EMNLP</span>, cross­words and other word
games, and en­joy­ing the last of the good Ann Arbor weather.</p><p>In line with March and September, <strong>November</strong> was quite event­ful. Election week
cov­er­age, deep fry­ing more food, at­tend­ing and pre­sent­ing at my first
con­fer­ence, and cel­e­brat­ing my 21st birth­day (by not go­ing to any of the bars)!
Some­how, a lot of these things also hap­pened in the same week&hellip;</p><p>Finally, <strong>December</strong> saw the end of the se­mes­ter and my in­tern­ship at <span class="small-caps">NBC</span>. It
also saw the re­newal of my cross­word and Netflix sub­scrip­tions, both of which I
was not com­fort­able main­tain­ing dur­ing the se­mes­ter.</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>This is the end of a <em>very</em> event­ful year. It’s one that I can safely say I did
not see com­ing, filled with dis­ap­point­ments and hard­ships. But it has also had
some re­ally amaz­ing mo­ments. With the switch to a new nor­mal in terms of me­dia
of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, I’ve been able to re­con­nect with many friends I’ve lost touch
with over the years. I’ve also had so many fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­ni­ties
pro­fes­sion­ally, and I’ve met some re­ally fan­tas­tic peo­ple at both <span class="small-caps">USC</span> and <span class="small-caps">NBC</span>.</p><p>And in the midst of per­sonal, na­tional, and in­ter­na­tional chaos, I’ve grown to
ap­pre­ci­ate so many of the things I used to take for granted: see­ing my friends
and loved ones in per­son; be­ing able to travel to China to visit my
grand­par­ents; see­ing the bot­tom halves of strangers faces. I’ve also learned to
take care of my­self in try­ing times: to cre­ate a space I want to live in; to
find joy in my rou­tines (think you cross­words); to reach out to my friends for
com­pany and sup­port.</p><p>Every year sees ups and downs, set­backs and growth. This year was no dif­fer­ent
in that re­gard, and I’m con­fi­dent that 2021, what­ever it has in store, will also
bring both plenty of dis­ap­point­ments and plenty of joy. In many ways, my lim­its
were tested this year&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;in some cases, I grew and stretched those lim­its. In
others, I saw the cracks and learned when I should ease back. The tri­als of this
past year have taught me a lot about my­self.</p><p>I’m look­ing for­ward to a year filled with new joys and new dis­ap­points. I’m
looking for­ward to a year where I can see and hug my fam­ily and friends. I’m
looking for­ward to the year I start my se­nior year of col­lege, where I meet new
peo­ple and ex­pe­ri­ence new things. But mostly, I’m look­ing for­ward to a year that
will hope­fully chill the fuck out.</p><p>Good night, 2020. Good morn­ing, 2021.</p></section>

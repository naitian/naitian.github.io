    <section><h2>Time flies</h2><p>Usually I post one of these on New Year’s Eve. Unfortunately, I was busy this
year watch­ing Michigan play<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Play might be too strong a term for what hap­pened on the field that night&hellip;</span> Alabama in the Orange Bowl, so here we are, a
few days later.</p></section>

<section><h2>This Year in Numbers</h2><p><strong>585</strong> Github con­tri­bu­tions (a new high score!)</p><p><strong>33</strong> more col­lege cred­its</p><p><strong>1</strong> Bachelor’s de­gree (!!)</p><p><strong>11</strong> PhD ap­pli­ca­tions</p><p>&hellip;and <strong>a lot</strong> of things on my mind.</p></section>
<section><h2>Highlights</h2><p>In <strong>January</strong>, I be­gan my penul­ti­mate se­mes­ter of col­lege (although I did­n’t
know it at the time). I also be­gan my term as one of the man­ag­ing on­line
ed­i­tors at <a href="https://michigandaily.com">The Michigan Daily</a> (more on this
later). I also got <em>su­per</em> into the <span class="small-caps">NYT</span> spelling bee, and I im­ple­mented Naive
Bayes for home­work for the third and fourth time.</p><p>In <strong>February</strong>, The Daily pub­lished a cou­ple of pro­jects and sto­ries that I
had a hand in: the <a href="https://magnify.michigandaily.us/love/">Statement Love
Edition</a>, which I helped co­or­di­nate,
and a <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/research/how-effective-are-stay-home-orders-and-recommendations-reducing-spread-covid-19/">data-dri­ven piece on Covid
cases</a>.
This would mark the be­gin­ning of a lot more rich on­line con­tent from The Daily.
I also got Sunday donuts from Loomi Cafe for the first time. This be­came a
weekly tra­di­tion that was un­for­tu­nately short-lived, as Loomi closed this December.</p><p><strong>March</strong> flew by with a lot of Daily work: a <em>bunch</em> more data sto­ries from
The Daily, in­clud­ing a multi-part piece on feeder schools that would go on to
win an award and get a ton of read­ers. We also pub­lished a spe­cial pro­ject,
re­flect­ing on one year of on­line classes. Finally, we launched a brand new
web­site, open­ing up a lot more flex­i­bil­ity in the pro­jects we’d be able to
tackle in the fu­ture.</p><p>In <strong>April</strong>, I got vac­ci­nated.</p><p>In <strong>May</strong>, it felt like the world once again ex­isted out­side the con­fines of
my own room, and I was ea­ger to take ad­van­tage. In roughly chrono­log­i­cal or­der,
I: helped my fam­ily move back to Troy, Michigan (after hav­ing moved from Troy
just a cou­ple years ago), learned to skate­board, read <em>Pachinko</em> and <em>Abolish
Silicon Valley</em>, at­tended my friend’s grad­u­a­tion at <span class="small-caps">UVA</span> and climbed Old Rag in
Shenan­doah. I also (virtually) be­gan my sum­mer in­tern­ship at the University of
Wash­ing­ton.</p><p>I de­parted for Seattle in <strong>June</strong>, opt­ing to take the Amtrak <em>Empire Builder</em>
from Chicago. This was a two-and-a-half day trip, and I loved every minute of
it (give or take). You can read some of my thoughts about it
<a href="https://twitter.com/NaitianZhou/status/1430571386263818245?s=20">here</a>. Aside
from the train trip, I ex­plored lots of Seattle (especially U District), went
on a few runs, climbed a cou­ple of moun­tains, and en­dured a re­ally killer heat
wave.</p><p><strong>July</strong> con­tained more Seattle ad­ven­tures, in­clud­ing more hik­ing, some
kayak­ing, a trip to Portland, and I got my Seattle Public Library card.</p><p>I wrapped up my time in Seattle in <strong>August</strong>. My par­ents came to see Mt.
Rainier and Olympic National Park with me be­fore we flew back home to Michigan.
I also be­gan my last ever se­mes­ter as an un­der­grad at the University of
Michi­gan.</p><p>In <strong>September</strong>, I house-sat a cat and it was the best week of my life.</p><p><strong>October</strong> was a Michigan fall, and I did all of the clas­sic Michigan fall
things™. This in­cluded a trip to a cider mill with the Blablablab, mak­ing my
<em>own</em> cider (also with the Blablablab), a cou­ple of back­yard bon­fires, and (of
course) a Michigan foot­ball game. I also sub­mit­ted my <span class="small-caps">NSF</span> <span class="small-caps">GRF</span> ap­pli­ca­tion.</p><p>I turned 22 in <strong>November</strong>. Oh yeah, and Michigan beat <span class="small-caps">OSU</span> for the first time
in close to a decade. That was a good day.</p><p>That brings us to <strong>December</strong>. If some of these months seem sparse in de­tail,
it’s be­cause this past year re­ally flew by&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;<em>es­pe­cially</em> this past month.
There were a lot of good-byes, a lot of lasts, and not a lot of time to process
all of it&hellip;</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>Which I sup­pose leads us to this sec­tion. Some time to process every­thing that
hap­pened this past year and, re­ally, these past three and a half years of
col­lege.</p><p>It’s hard to know where to be­gin, so maybe I’ll con­tex­tu­al­ize by start­ing with
my <em>last</em> grad­u­a­tion. When I grad­u­ated from high school, I felt a sense of
com­ple­tion and a re­ally strong op­ti­mism for the fu­ture. This is what I wrote in
my 2018 re­flec­tion:</p><blockquote>
<p>I can only hope that the next five years will be as ful­fill­ing and
in­ter­est­ing and fun as the past five. I hope that, just as I found a home in
Vir­ginia, I’ll find a home in Michigan, and wher­ever life might take me next.</p>
</blockquote><p>What I had­n’t an­tic­i­pated was the tu­mult. The best way to de­scribe the past
cou­ple of years would be ca­reen­ing down the in­ter­state with the win­dows down,
and a stray news­pa­per just flew into my face. Thrilling, sure, but also
ter­ri­fy­ing.</p><p>I’m end­ing my years at Michigan a se­mes­ter early (I achieved this through a
con­vo­luted se­ries of events, which is fit for a whole other post&hellip;) It feels
like I’ve slammed on the brakes, flown out of the ve­hi­cle, and ex­tended this
anal­ogy past its break­ing point. What I’m try­ing to say is, I don’t feel the
same sense of clo­sure that I felt four years ago af­ter high school.</p><p>I’m sure this is in no small part due to the crazy cir­cum­stances of the past
cou­ple of years. Aside from a global pan­demic that re­sulted in my course­work
be­ing on­line for half of the time I was at Michigan, my fam­ily has also moved
four times in three years, mean­ing some­how I’ve ac­cu­mu­lated five or six
dif­fer­ent Michigan zip codes. When I said I hoped to find a home in Michigan, I
should have clar­i­fied: I’d be con­tent with just one, and not six.</p><p>But pre­ma­ture de­par­tures, pan­demics and Zhou fam­ily mi­gra­tion pat­terns are
triv­ial in the big­ger pic­ture of my ex­pe­ri­ence at (in, and around) Michigan.
They may have made this end­ing come sooner or seem quicker in its ap­proach, but
I doubt I’d be any more pre­pared with any amount of lead time. I have put a lot
of my­self into the peo­ple and or­ga­ni­za­tions and life in Ann Arbor, and it’s
hard to imag­ine wav­ing good­bye to all of that.</p><p>I’m proud to have helped build up two stel­lar stu­dent or­ga­ni­za­tions from close
to noth­ing: the Michigan Data Science Team and the web team at The Michigan
Daily. They are in ex­cel­lent hands now, but it’s still hard to say good­bye. But
even greater than that, I’m proud to have built so many last­ing re­la­tion­ships
with peo­ple here&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;peo­ple I can laugh with, con­fide in, rant to, seek sup­port
from. Those are the hard­est good­byes.</p><p>Fulfilling, in­ter­est­ing and fun? Definitely.</p><p>That brings us to now: I’ve ap­plied to PhD pro­grams which I’m wait­ing to hear
back from, which means I’m tem­porar­ily stuck look­ing ahead into a bright cloud
of com­plete un­cer­tainty.</p><p>Usually, at the end of these re­flec­tions, I like to take a look for­ward into
the next year. This time, though, I don’t think that’s fea­si­ble. I don’t know
where I will phys­i­cally be this time next year, much less what I’ll be do­ing or
what I’ll have to look for­ward to. Just&hellip; some­thing in­ter­est­ing, prob­a­bly.</p><p>So I’ll bide my time for now, sit­ting with my feet dan­gling off a precipice
over­look­ing the en­tire rest of my life. I think I’ll spend the next cou­ple of
months sa­vor­ing the end of the be­gin­ning.</p></section>

    <h1 class="title">The 600 Mile Marathon</h1>
    <section><h2>Starting at the fin­ish line</h2><p>I ran the Banff Marathon on Sunday, June 19th. I fin­ished in 4 hours and 11 min­utes, but the race was the cul­mi­na­tion of a train­ing ef­fort that took months. It was the most dif­fi­cult thing I have ever done.</p><!-- [^1] --><!-- [^1]: Just a quick note: I wrote this without a real plan of what I wanted to say. While I think there's a nice chord progression into a key change at the end, it also means the impact is in the last section. So even though I want you to read the whole thing (of course), you should definitely at the very least read the last part. --></section>

<section><h2>Starting at the start (or why I did this to my­self)</h2><p>I grad­u­ated a se­mes­ter early, so I was search­ing for some­thing to fill up my ex­tra time. Having just sub­mit­ted my grad school ap­pli­ca­tions in December, I de­cided to run a marathon, an am­bi­tious un­der­tak­ing that is <a href="https://ristretto.black/what-if-your-phd-didnt-need-to-feel-as-long-and-tiring-as-a-marathon/">fre­quently</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ithinkwellHugh/status/751408154936684544?s=20&#x26;t=N5UJeAY-fmFUgdu_69YGYA">com­pared</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/06/doing-a-phd-is-as-tough-as-training-for-a-marathon-and-im-doing-both">to a</a> cer­tain other one that <a href="https://naitian.org/blog/why-phd/">I re­cently com­mit­ted to</a><label for="phd" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="phd" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://naitian.org/blog/why-phd/"><em>Why do I want to do a PhD?</em></a></span>.</p><p>A nat­ural-born ath­lete, I am not. I was on the track team in high school, but
as a pole vaulter so I could min­i­mize the amount of run­ning to about 60 feet at
a time. I tried and failed to pick up dis­tance run­ning as a hobby mul­ti­ple
times in the past. Being a run­ner was some­thing I had al­ways as­pired to, but
never ac­tu­ally achieved.</p><p>I wanted to run be­cause it seemed like a cheap<label for="cheap" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="cheap" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">It turns out run­ning shoes are not cheap.</span>, healthy<label for="healthy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="healthy" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">It turns out it’s pretty com­mon to get in­jured run­ning.</span>
activity that I could do any­where. But more im­por­tantly, I wanted to run to
prove to my­self that I could. I fig­ured the push to a marathon fin­ish would
yield some amount of self-dis­ci­pline and other use­ful lessons I could take with
me as I started my PhD in the fall.</p></section>
<section><h2>The jour­ney, not the des­ti­na­tion</h2><p>Having ex­plic­itly de­cided to run a marathon as a char­ac­ter-build­ing ex­er­cise,
here are the char­ac­ter-build­ing lessons I learned in the process (in no
par­tic­u­lar or­der):</p><ol>
<li><strong>There will al­ways be bad miles.</strong> It’s im­pos­si­ble to run a lot and feel
good about every mile. The bad runs&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the ones that were slow or painful or
just felt harder than they <em>should’ve</em>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;are in­evitable. Just ac­cept it and
look for­ward to the next run.</li>
<li><strong>Take time off to re­cover.</strong> I was guilty of not do­ing this enough in my
train­ing block, which re­sulted in the knee in­jury I’m hob­bling around with
now. It’s tempt­ing to stick to the sched­ule, es­pe­cially when there’s a set
dead­line, but that can lead to worse in­juries and worse per­for­mance in the
fu­ture.</li>
<li><strong>Be con­sis­tent, but be flex­i­ble.</strong> I trav­eled a lot in March and April
visiting grad schools. My sched­ule was all over the place, and I fre­quently
had flights on days I was sup­posed to run. This meant I had to shift my
train­ing around to ac­com­mo­date. That can be dif­fi­cult be­cause I was lean­ing
heav­ily on a set train­ing plan to make up for my lack of ex­pe­ri­ence, but it
also meant I got to go on some very scenic runs in Switzerland and Ithaca
and Berkeley (with lots of hill run­ning).</li>
<li><strong>Run your own race.</strong>  I’m a com­pet­i­tive per­son, and I feel the strong
temp­ta­tion to pass peo­ple, but I had to learn to run at my own pace. Getting
a run­ning watch helped me to keep my own time, but I also learned to ac­cept
that every­one is train­ing at dif­fer­ent lev­els. I set a time goal I’d
personally be happy with and fo­cused on that in­stead of com­par­ing my­self to
oth­ers.</li>
<li><strong>Lean on your sup­port net­work.</strong> Having (and find­ing) a com­mu­nity also
helped me a lot. My friends helped me so much with en­cour­age­ment and gen­eral
en­thu­si­asm for my plan, and the broader run­ning com­mu­nity is so sup­port­ive
and will­ing to share knowl­edge with run­ners at all lev­els.</li>
<li><strong><span class="pull-double">“</span>Just keep run­ning.”</strong> When push came to shove and I was feel­ing all sorts
of pain at mile 24 of the race, I knew I had to just push my­self to run to
the fin­ish. For the last 2k of the race, I kept re­peat­ing to my­self the
mantra of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>just keep run­ning”. Focusing on putting one step in front of the
other, I tried to ig­nore the pain. Eventually, I rounded the cor­ner and the
fin­ish line came into view.</li>
</ol></section>
<section><h2>Finishing past the fin­ish line</h2><p>Crossing the fin­ish line, I felt such an over­whelm­ing sense of re­lief that I
burst into tears. The race did­n’t just span the 26.2 miles I had run that day,
but the 600+ miles I had run in the months lead­ing up to it.</p><p>Within an hour of fin­ish­ing, though, I al­ready found my­self think­ing about the
next race I wanted to run. So here’s biggest les­son I learned in this whole
ex­pe­ri­ence, and one that I did­n’t un­der­stand un­til the very end: <strong>there is
al­ways go­ing to be the next race</strong>.</p><p>I have a habit of get­ting into ob­ses­sive sprints: two days to code a web­site,
six months to run a marathon, a year to fin­ish a pa­per. Even when I was
train­ing for an en­durance race, I ap­proached it with a fix­a­tion on a sin­gle,
short-term goal: fin­ish the Banff Marathon in June.</p><p>That ap­proach has aligned closely with my world so far, which was one
de­lin­eated by quar­ters and se­mes­ters and fi­nal ex­ams. But look­ing into the
fu­ture, the ter­mi­nal points are be­com­ing less clear, and short ob­ses­sive bursts
of en­ergy ei­ther won’t be enough or will cause me pain in the long run<label for="lol" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="lol" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Heh. Get it?</span>.</p><p>Facing this re­al­ity is scary, and I’m sure in­ter­nal­iz­ing and ad­just­ing to it
will be hard&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;maybe the most dif­fi­cult thing I have ever done. But I’ve
learned a lot about run­ning long runs and do­ing dif­fi­cult things in the past
few months; I feel con­fi­dent now that I’ll learn plenty more in the years to
come.</p></section>

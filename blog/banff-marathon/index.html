    <h1 class="title">The 600 Mile Marathon</h1>
    <section><h2>Starting at the finish line</h2><p>I ran the Banff Marathon on Sunday, June 19th. I finished in 4 hours and 11 minutes, but the race was the culmination of a training effort that took months. It was the most difficult thing I have ever done.</p><!-- [^1] --><!-- [^1]: Just a quick note: I wrote this without a real plan of what I wanted to say. While I think there's a nice chord progression into a key change at the end, it also means the impact is in the last section. So even though I want you to read the whole thing (of course), you should definitely at the very least read the last part. --></section>

<section><h2>Starting at the start (or why I did this to myself)</h2><p>I graduated a semester early, so I was searching for something to fill up my extra time. Having just submitted my grad school applications in December, I decided to run a marathon, an ambitious undertaking that is <a href="https://ristretto.black/what-if-your-phd-didnt-need-to-feel-as-long-and-tiring-as-a-marathon/">frequently</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ithinkwellHugh/status/751408154936684544?s=20&#x26;t=N5UJeAY-fmFUgdu_69YGYA">compared</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/06/doing-a-phd-is-as-tough-as-training-for-a-marathon-and-im-doing-both">to a</a> certain other one that <a href="https://naitian.org/blog/why-phd/">I recently committed to</a><label for="phd" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="phd" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://naitian.org/blog/why-phd/"><em>Why do I want to do a PhD?</em></a></span>.</p><p>A natural-born athlete, I am not. I was on the track team in high school, but
as a pole vaulter so I could minimize the amount of running to about 60 feet at
a time. I tried and failed to pick up distance running as a hobby multiple
times in the past. Being a runner was something I had always aspired to, but
never actually achieved.</p><p>I wanted to run because it seemed like a cheap<label for="cheap" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="cheap" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">It turns out running shoes are not cheap.</span>, healthy<label for="healthy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="healthy" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">It turns out it's pretty common to get injured running.</span>
activity that I could do anywhere. But more importantly, I wanted to run to
prove to myself that I could. I figured the push to a marathon finish would
yield some amount of self-discipline and other useful lessons I could take with
me as I started my PhD in the fall.</p></section>
<section><h2>The journey, not the destination</h2><p>Having explicitly decided to run a marathon as a character-building exercise,
here are the character-building lessons I learned in the process (in no
particular order):</p><ol>
<li><strong>There will always be bad miles.</strong> It's impossible to run a lot and feel
good about every mile. The bad runs -- the ones that were slow or painful or
just felt harder than they <em>should've</em> -- are inevitable. Just accept it and
look forward to the next run.</li>
<li><strong>Take time off to recover.</strong> I was guilty of not doing this enough in my
training block, which resulted in the knee injury I'm hobbling around with
now. It's tempting to stick to the schedule, especially when there's a set
deadline, but that can lead to worse injuries and worse performance in the
future.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent, but be flexible.</strong> I traveled a lot in March and April
visiting grad schools. My schedule was all over the place, and I frequently
had flights on days I was supposed to run. This meant I had to shift my
training around to accommodate. That can be difficult because I was leaning
heavily on a set training plan to make up for my lack of experience, but it
also meant I got to go on some very scenic runs in Switzerland and Ithaca
and Berkeley (with lots of hill running).</li>
<li><strong>Run your own race.</strong>  I'm a competitive person, and I feel the strong
temptation to pass people, but I had to learn to run at my own pace. Getting
a running watch helped me to keep my own time, but I also learned to accept
that everyone is training at different levels. I set a time goal I'd
personally be happy with and focused on that instead of comparing myself to
others.</li>
<li><strong>Lean on your support network.</strong> Having (and finding) a community also
helped me a lot. My friends helped me so much with encouragement and general
enthusiasm for my plan, and the broader running community is so supportive
and willing to share knowledge with runners at all levels.</li>
<li><strong>"Just keep running."</strong> When push came to shove and I was feeling all sorts
of pain at mile 24 of the race, I knew I had to just push myself to run to
the finish. For the last 2k of the race, I kept repeating to myself the
mantra of "just keep running". Focusing on putting one step in front of the
other, I tried to ignore the pain. Eventually, I rounded the corner and the
finish line came into view.</li>
</ol></section>
<section><h2>Finishing past the finish line</h2><p>Crossing the finish line, I felt such an overwhelming sense of relief that I
burst into tears. The race didn't just span the 26.2 miles I had run that day,
but the 600+ miles I had run in the months leading up to it.</p><p>Within an hour of finishing, though, I already found myself thinking about the
next race I wanted to run. So here's biggest lesson I learned in this whole
experience, and one that I didn't understand until the very end: <strong>there is
always going to be the next race</strong>.</p><p>I have a habit of getting into obsessive sprints: two days to code a website,
six months to run a marathon, a year to finish a paper. Even when I was
training for an endurance race, I approached it with a fixation on a single,
short-term goal: finish the Banff Marathon in June.</p><p>That approach has aligned closely with my world so far, which was one
delineated by quarters and semesters and final exams. But looking into the
future, the terminal points are becoming less clear, and short obsessive bursts
of energy either won't be enough or will cause me pain in the long run<label for="lol" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="lol" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Heh. Get it?</span>.</p><p>Facing this reality is scary, and I'm sure internalizing and adjusting to it
will be hard -- maybe the most difficult thing I have ever done. But I've
learned a lot about running long runs and doing difficult things in the past
few months; I feel confident now that I'll learn plenty more in the years to
come.</p></section>

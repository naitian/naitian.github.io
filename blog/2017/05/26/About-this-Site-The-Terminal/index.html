    <h1 class="title">About this Site - The Terminal</h1>
    <h3>I'm Back!</h3>
<p>I've been planning on continuing my "About this Site" series for a while now
(like over 2 months), but I guess I've been distracted with other things (as a
high schooler does). Regardless, partly due to the prompting of a friend, here
is the third installment.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>I believe I have waxed poetic about the command line before. I most definitely
will in the future if I have not already. I was, therefore, kind of infatuated
with the idea of a website that has a little command line built into it. This
was implemented in my original website, where I even added scan lines and a
subtle flicker to really drive home the retro feel.</p>
<figure class="figure">

    <figcaption class="img-caption">My old website</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For this refresh, though, I wanted to make something cleaner. More importantly,
I wanted to make something that required very little maintenance.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>First, let's go through some of the problems with the previous Javascript
terminal. For one thing, there were errors that were straight up ignored (to be
fair, this error didn't break any functionality).</p>
<figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/old_terminal_errors.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Look at all those
errors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also, just about everything, from the commands to the available files, was
hardcoded. This meant if I were to add a new section to my site, I would have to
manually update that code. What a drag. It ended up with code that looked like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (parsed.cmd === <span class="hljs-string">'open'</span>) {
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> target = <span class="hljs-string">'#'</span> + parsed.arg;
$.smoothScroll({
<span class="hljs-attr">scrollTarget</span>: target
});
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (parsed.cmd === <span class="hljs-string">'ls'</span>) {
out = <span class="hljs-string">'about&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;projects&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;&#x26;nbsp;contact'</span>;
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
out = <span class="hljs-string">'That command is not yet supported. Try ls or open.'</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ewwwww.</p>
<h3>Specs</h3>
<p>So for this new and improved terminal, I wanted several features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better design (this meant a visible, blinking cursor)</li>
<li>Procedurally generated files (this proved to be the most challenging)</li>
<li>Extensible command system (I used ES6 classes for this)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Let's Get Down to Business</h3>
<p>We're not going to defeat the Huns, but we <em>are</em> going to make our new and
improved terminal.</p>
<h4>Better Design</h4>
<p>Okay, so this one is kind of vague. I mocked up the <a href="/blog/2017-03-05-About-this-Site---Design/">design</a>, which was heavily
inspired by my actual terminal.</p>
<p>The most difficult part was probably hiding the cursor and replacing it with a
block cursor. I still don't have a perfect implementation - in case you didn't
realize, you can't actually move the cursor around on the line. It just stays at
the end of the line.</p>
<p>The thing about the cursor (or caret, if you'd like) is that it is always the
same color as your text. There's no way to style it individually. The trick here
is to <strong>make the text transparent</strong>. Then, just add a text-shadow with your text
color and no offset. This keeps everything the same except for the caret, which
is now transparent!</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-id">#input</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: transparent;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">text-shadow</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-number">#0EFF1F</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Wow!! Nice.</p>
<p>Another big problem was making scrolling work nicely. This was more difficult
than you would initially expect, because the input is a <code>contentEditable</code> div,
while the rest of the text is a separate div. A couple of <code>overflow</code> rules did
the job nicely, though.</p>
<h4>Procedural Generation</h4>
<p>This is the cool part! My biggest gripe with the old implementation was how much
was hardcoded. I wanted to be able to more or less browse the entire site with
the terminal, so hardcoding everything was not a viable option.</p>
<p>This means I needed an API or something to query for all of the different parts
of the site. Fortunately, I have Jekyll!</p>
<p>Here's the amazing thing about Jekyll: it can generate <strong>any</strong> document. This
includes not just Markdown or HTML files. The trick is to use Jekyll to generate
a JSON file with information about the website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>mind = blown</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the entire contents of <code>terminal.json</code>, which is the relevant JSON
file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-js">---
---
{% capture nl %}
{% endcapture %}
{% assign files = site.documents %}
{% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> page <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> site.html_pages %}
{% assign files = files | push: page %}
{% endfor %}
{
    {% <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> page <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> files %}
    <span class="hljs-string">"{{ page.url }}"</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-string">"content"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"{{ page.content | replace: '"</span><span class="hljs-string">', "'</span><span class="hljs-string">" | normalize_whitespace}}"</span>
    }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}
    {% endfor %}
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's all there is to it. This generates a JSON object of all of the pages in
the website, with the url as the key and including the content as the sole
property of each page.</p>
<p>You end up with a JSON file looking like <a href="https://naitian.org/terminal.json">this</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this is still not wonderful, because all we have now is a bunch of file
paths. This doesn't encode information about what is and is not in the current
directory.</p>
<p>So I added a <code>pwd</code> variable. I now realize <code>pwd</code> stands for "print working
directory", so it doesn't really make sense to name a variable that, but in my
mind, it just means "our current working directory", and <code>ocwd</code> just doesn't have the same ring to it. I use this to keep track of where in the tree I am at the moment</p>
<p>I then search down the list of files to see which paths are direct children of
the <code>pwd</code>.</p>
<p>Everything else is pretty straightforward: I just inject the <code>content</code> of the
selected path.</p>
<p>This is what gets me the procedurally generated functionality of the terminal.
That's not all I wanted though; I wanted it to be even more dynamic. I wanted
the terminal to be extensible, so that I would be able to add new commands
really easily.</p>
<p>Well then. Let's get started.</p>
<h4>Extensibility</h4>
<p>I decided on using ES6 classes to organize the JavaScript into a self-contained
unit.I've experimented with this before to some success.</p>
<p>The actual implementation was very strightforward. I basically have a map of
possible commands mapped to the functions that they call. All of the commands
have access to the instance variables. Easy, clean stuff.</p>
<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>So I guess that sums up the tech componenet of the terminal easter egg. Even
though it was just an easter egg, it was probably one of the things I spent the
most time on, just to get everything working okay.</p>
<h4>Improvements</h4>
<p>There are still some improvements to be made; some (obviously) less trivial than
others.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want tab completion.</li>
<li>I want to be able to register new commands outside of the actual class</li>
<li>Lists extend horizontally, not vertically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I'm really happy with how it turned out, though, and I think this is a
great foundation to keep building on.</p>

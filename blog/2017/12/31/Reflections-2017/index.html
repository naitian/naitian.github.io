<section><h2>Hello again</h2><p>It's been a while. I've been pretty busy doing senior year things like college applications and senior research (<em>cough</em> not really). But anyway, I figured now would be a good time to reflect on this past year - what I did, what I didn't do, and what I should be doing next year.</p></section>
<section><h2>This Year in Numbers</h2><p><strong>563</strong> Github Contributions</p><p><strong>1</strong> Palantir Social Impact Prize</p><p><strong>4</strong> weeks spent surviving PHP and MySQL during my internship, during which:</p><ul>
<li>I added <strong>18</strong> hotels</li>
<li>processed <strong>64</strong> images</li>
<li>and modified <strong>10055</strong> lines of code!</li>
</ul><p><strong>6</strong> college applications submitted (and <strong>1</strong> acceptance received!!!)</p><p>In Ion, I made <strong>168</strong> commits, with <strong>4230</strong> additions and <strong>6669</strong> deletions.</p><p>I cleared <strong>10</strong> feet in pole vault, very narrowly qualifying myself for states!</p><p><strong>3</strong> AP exams taken</p></section>
<section><h2>Revisiting Last Year</h2><p>I made a post on January 1st that listed some goals for the year. Let's see how well I did.</p><h3>This Website</h3><blockquote>
<p>There’s still lots of work to be done, particularly in the little “terminal” easter egg on the home page, but I’m very happy with the site.</p>
</blockquote><p>I definitely worked on the website quite a bit this year. I fixed some big bugs with the terminal, and added some useful tools to improve my workflow. It's definitely a lot of fun to work on.</p><h3>This Blog</h3><blockquote>
<p>I definitely plan on posting more, and hopefully at least once every week</p>
</blockquote><p>Oops. I kinda dropped the ball on this one... That said, I did post more often than before, and I attribute that entirely to a smoother creation flow.</p><h3>This Life</h3><blockquote>
<p>That said, I’ll take to heart Dory’s advice of “Just keep swimming”, and keep you guys updated.</p>
</blockquote><p>Update: I kept swimming, and finished junior pretty darn strong. It was hard, but totally worth it.</p></section>
<section><h2>Looking forward</h2><p>Here are my resolutions for this year:</p><ul>
<li>Go to college</li>
<li>Clear 11'</li>
<li>Double the number of blog posts</li>
<li>Get 100 stars on Github.</li>
</ul></section>

    <section><h2>Organizing My Thoughts</h2><p>I’m writ­ing this blog post on New Year’s Day, brac­ing my­self for the vi­o­lent
reen­try into my hec­tic school life in less than 2 days. I think this is a good
op­por­tu­nity for me to take a step back and or­ga­nize my thoughts while I still
have the time (and pa­tience), so here goes.</p></section>

<section><h2>This Website</h2><p>I’ve spent the ma­jor­ity of my win­ter break work­ing on this web­site. It’s built
with blood, sweat, and tears, ex­cept in­stead of blood I used Jekyll, and in­stead
of sweat and tears I used Sass and <span class="small-caps">HTML</span>.</p><p>This was also my first time work­ing with Sass, so def­i­nitely ex­pect some­thing
about that ex­pe­ri­ence soon. In fact, I did­n’t ex­pect to be us­ing Sass, un­til my
hand was ba­si­cally forced when I wanted to use any type of as­set pipeline for
min­i­miz­ing and op­ti­miz­ing my as­sets.</p><p>There’s still lots of work to be done, par­tic­u­larly in the lit­tle<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>terminal”
easter egg on the home page, but I’m very happy with the site.</p></section>
<section><h2>This Blog</h2><p>After fin­ish­ing the first ver­sion of the blog some­time in May of <strike>this
year</strike> last year, I up­loaded my first post (about Chrome Dev Tools), and
then promptly ig­nored it for the rest of the year. I def­i­nitely plan on post­ing
more, and hope­fully at least once every week, with ei­ther tid­bits of my per­sonal
life or tech­ni­cal ad­vice.</p></section>
<section><h2>This Life (Mine, Not Yours)</h2><p>I ex­pect that, once I en­ter the halls of Thomas Jefferson High School for
Sci­ence and Technology, I will once again be faced with the chal­lenges of
bal­anc­ing school­work with every­thing else that I want to do, in­clud­ing Dev Club,
this blog, band, and so much more. So how do I plan on stay­ing afloat? If only I
knew. That said, I’ll take to heart Dory’s ad­vice of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Just keep swim­ming”, and
keep you guys up­dated.</p></section>
<section><h2>Speaking of Being Updated&hellip;</h2><p>Subscribe to this blog us­ing the <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> feed!</p><p>Anyway, Happy New Year’s, and I hope you’re as ex­cited as I am (despite my
moan­ing and groan­ing) to start this year off strong.</p></section>

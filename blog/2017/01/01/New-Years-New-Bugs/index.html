    <section><h2>Organizing My Thoughts</h2><p>I'm writing this blog post on New Year's Day, bracing myself for the violent
reentry into my hectic school life in less than 2 days. I think this is a good
opportunity for me to take a step back and organize my thoughts while I still
have the time (and patience), so here goes.</p></section>

<section><h2>This Website</h2><p>I've spent the majority of my winter break working on this website. It's built
with blood, sweat, and tears, except instead of blood I used Jekyll, and instead
of sweat and tears I used Sass and HTML.</p><p>This was also my first time working with Sass, so definitely expect something
about that experience soon. In fact, I didn't expect to be using Sass, until my
hand was basically forced when I wanted to use any type of asset pipeline for
minimizing and optimizing my assets.</p><p>There's still lots of work to be done, particularly in the little "terminal"
easter egg on the home page, but I'm very happy with the site.</p></section>
<section><h2>This Blog</h2><p>After finishing the first version of the blog sometime in May of <strike>this
year</strike> last year, I uploaded my first post (about Chrome Dev Tools), and
then promptly ignored it for the rest of the year. I definitely plan on posting
more, and hopefully at least once every week, with either tidbits of my personal
life or technical advice.</p></section>
<section><h2>This Life (Mine, Not Yours)</h2><p>I expect that, once I enter the halls of Thomas Jefferson High School for
Science and Technology, I will once again be faced with the challenges of
balancing schoolwork with everything else that I want to do, including Dev Club,
this blog, band, and so much more. So how do I plan on staying afloat? If only I
knew. That said, I'll take to heart Dory's advice of "Just keep swimming", and
keep you guys updated.</p></section>

moaning and groaning) to start this year off strong.</p></section>

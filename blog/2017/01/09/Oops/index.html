    <h1 class="title">Oops! and Why I Use Vim</h1>
    <section><h2>A Quick Apology</h2><p>So a lit­tle over a week ago, I wrote my first post of the year, de­tail­ing a
cou­ple of my goals, one of which was to hope­fully re­lease a blog post every
week. Oops&hellip; That lasted for a to­tal of one week&hellip;</p><p>Anyway.</p></section>
<section><h2>An Unhealthy Obsession</h2><p>A cou­ple of months ago, I switched to us­ing Vim full-time to do all of my text
edit­ing (coding and writ­ing Markdown&hellip; I still use <span class="small-caps">MS</span> Word for rich text
edit­ing).</p><p>When I say I can’t go back to Sublime Text any­more, it’s not be­cause I’m in love
with every­thing about Vim. It’s not even that (despite what some peo­ple may say)
Vim has shown me the flaws of all of the other graph­i­cal text ed­i­tors in the
world. In fact, I some­times find my­self miss­ing all of the thought­ful,
plug-and-play as­pects of Sublime Text, like how easy them­ing it is, or how
seam­less the au­to­com­ple­tion is, or how pack­age man­ager (with Package Control)
“just works”.</p><p>The real rea­son I can’t go back to Sublime any­more is be­cause, when­ever I want
to save a file, I end up typ­ing<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">”</span></p><div></div>″ be­fore I re­al­ize I needed to
press Command-S. Oops.<p></p><p>So you may be won­der­ing to your­self, <em>Why would Naitian ever have wanted to use
Vim then?</em></p><p>Good ques­tion.</p></section>
<section><h2>An Unlikely Romance (OoooOOOOoooo)</h2><p>The orig­i­nal mo­tive was not to be­come a l33t hax0r that lives in the ter­mi­nal.
Oops. My ex­pe­ri­ence with the com­mand line has been one of slow, be­grudg­ing
ac­cep­tance. I like to imag­ine it as a buddy film where the ini­tial mu­tual
dis­dain slowly blooms into a won­der­ful friend­ship.</p><p>Movie analo­gies aside, the true rea­son I chose to use Vim was be­cause I could
use Vim with tmux, which meant I had full con­trol over how my text ed­i­tor and
ter­mi­nal em­u­la­tor meshed to­gether. It was like a tiling win­dow man­ager ex­cept I
didn’t need to in­stall a tiling wm. Is that a weird, con­vo­luted ex­cuse to use
vim? Yes, but that be the truth.</p><p>Well, af­ter I played around with the <code>vimrc</code> for a lit­tle bit, I was hooked on
how con­fig­urable vim was (I’m a sucker for con­fig files), and the rest is
his­tory.</p></section>
<section><h2>The Happy Ending</h2><p>So now I use Vim every day to do every­thing from writ­ing this sen­tence to
mak­ing my web­site to do­ing my <span class="small-caps">AI</span> labs.</p><p>Expect a post on how I use Vim com­ing up soon (hopefully next week when I
<em>don’t</em> for­get to post&hellip;)</p><p>Also! You know what would make the end­ing even hap­pier? If you used that handy
dandy <span class="small-caps">RSS</span> link in that footer down there to sub­scribe to this blog and read all
of these mildly amus­ing posts!</p></section>

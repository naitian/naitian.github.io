    <h1 class="title">About this Site - Intro</h1>
    <p><em>Edited 3/6/17 to add in new links and change ti­tle.</em></p>
<section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I spent the bet­ter part of my win­ter break re­vamp­ing my per­sonal web­site (of
which this blog is a com­po­nent). You can view the old site here:
<a href="https://naitian.github.io">nait­ian.github.io</a>.</p><p>If you want to skip to an­other part of this walk­through, I have links to all of
the avail­able parts listed for you here:</p><ol>
<li><strong><a href="/blog/2017-03-05-About-this-Site---Design/">Design</a></strong></li>
</ol></section>
<section><h2>Setting Goals</h2><p>I think it’s im­por­tant to con­sider what the goals, de­sires, and re­quire­ments are
for every pro­ject.</p><p>While I was gen­er­ally sat­is­fied with the old web­site, there were some is­sues that I felt
needed ad­dress­ing.</p><ul>
<li>The over­abun­dance of col­ors pulled from
<a href="http://flatuicolors.com">fla­tu­i­col­ors.com</a> was busy, and seemed like it
was­n’t well thought out.</li>
<li>The ter­mi­nal in the back­ground never worked very well, and ul­ti­mately
did­n’t do every­thing I wanted it to. <strong>I wanted a dy­namic<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>terminal” through
which you could ba­si­cally browse the en­tire web­site</strong>.</li>
<li>I had got­ten tired of the one-page lay­out, af­ter also us­ing for the <a href="https://tjdev.club">Dev
Club Website</a>, so <strong>I wanted to chal­lenge my­self with a
new type of lay­out</strong>.</li>
<li>I wanted to start up the blog again, and the orig­i­nal Jekyll blog was kind
of a pain to work with. <strong>I wanted to min­i­mize the fric­tion in­volved with
pub­lish­ing new posts</strong>, which would in turn en­cour­age me to write more.</li>
</ul><p>Okay, so those were the things that I took is­sue with. However, there were some
as­pects of the site that I wanted to keep.</p><ul>
<li>I liked the ter­mi­nal; it’s fun and nerdy. So I wanted to keep it, but maybe
make it a bit more sub­tle.</li>
<li>I liked hav­ing dis­tinct col­ors for the dif­fer­ent sec­tions.</li>

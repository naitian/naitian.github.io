    <h1 class="title">About this Site - Intro</h1>
    <p><em>Edited 3/6/17 to add in new links and change title.</em></p>
<section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I spent the better part of my winter break revamping my personal website (of
which this blog is a component). You can view the old site here:
<a href="https://naitian.github.io">naitian.github.io</a>.</p><p>If you want to skip to another part of this walkthrough, I have links to all of
the available parts listed for you here:</p><ol>
<li><strong><a href="/blog/2017-03-05-About-this-Site---Design/">Design</a></strong></li>
</ol></section>
<section><h2>Setting Goals</h2><p>I think it's important to consider what the goals, desires, and requirements are
for every project.</p><p>While I was generally satisfied with the old website, there were some issues that I felt
needed addressing.</p><ul>
<li>The overabundance of colors pulled from
<a href="http://flatuicolors.com">flatuicolors.com</a> was busy, and seemed like it
wasn't well thought out.</li>
<li>The terminal in the background never worked very well, and ultimately
didn't do everything I wanted it to. <strong>I wanted a dynamic "terminal" through
which you could basically browse the entire website</strong>.</li>
<li>I had gotten tired of the one-page layout, after also using for the <a href="https://tjdev.club">Dev
Club Website</a>, so <strong>I wanted to challenge myself with a
new type of layout</strong>.</li>
<li>I wanted to start up the blog again, and the original Jekyll blog was kind
of a pain to work with. <strong>I wanted to minimize the friction involved with
publishing new posts</strong>, which would in turn encourage me to write more.</li>
</ul><p>Okay, so those were the things that I took issue with. However, there were some
aspects of the site that I wanted to keep.</p><ul>
<li>I liked the terminal; it's fun and nerdy. So I wanted to keep it, but maybe
make it a bit more subtle.</li>
<li>I liked having distinct colors for the different sections.</li>

    <section><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>After get­ting an idea of what I wanted to ac­com­plish with the site (which I
detailed in the pre­vi­ous post), I was ready to be­gin de­sign­ing.</p></section>

<section><h2>Sketching</h2><p>I nor­mally start out with sketch­ing some ideas. Conveniently, I was go­ing to
Seat­tle for win­ter break, so the hours on the flight sans in­ter­net was
well-used.</p><p>I find sketch­ing to be use­ful for fig­ur­ing out lay­out and the flow of con­tent. I
was now ready to start mak­ing some mock­ups.</p></section>
<section><h2>Mockups</h2><p>I use <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/">Affinity Designer</a> for all of
my com­puter graph­ics work. I used to use Adobe Illustrator be­fore I switched
com­put­ers, and the over­all work­flow is very sim­i­lar, which meant a pretty low
learn­ing curve for the tran­si­tion.</p><h3>Home</h3><p>I started with the home page. I tried to keep it sim­ple, and al­low it to act as
a hub to all of the other pages.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/home_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">The in­dex of the site</figcaption>
</figure><p>I also wanted to keep the ter­mi­nal, and ul­ti­mately de­cided on adding a lit­tle
flip tab to re­veal the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>inside” of the site.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/home_unveiled_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">The hid­den
ter­mi­nal.</figcaption>
</figure><h3>About</h3><p>One of the first con­di­tions for the About page was that I had to in­clude a
pic­ture of my­self. However, im­ages al­ways raise the risk of dis­rupt­ing the
styl­is­tic con­sis­tency (especially when the photo is­n’t that good). I
eventually de­cided to add an over­lay of the theme color.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/about_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Both the desk­top and mo­bile
lay­outs</figcaption>
</figure><h3>Art</h3><p>A huge rea­son for the re­design of the site was be­cause I wanted a place for me
to show off the things that I draw and de­sign. This is where the de­sign things
got in­ter­est­ing.</p><p>For the home page of the Art sec­tion, I wanted to keep it as a sim­ple mo­saic
lay­out, with­out any text. In fact, in the orig­i­nal de­sign, I had en­vi­sioned
tiled and in­ter­lock­ing blocks. The goal was to have a wall of art, and click­ing
on one would lead you to a page ex­plain­ing the piece in greater de­tail.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/art_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Mockup for home page of art</figcaption>
</figure><p>This de­tail page was more in­ter­est­ing to work with. I wanted to cast at­ten­tion
pri­mar­ily upon the work, so I chose a dark back­ground. The piece is dis­played
promi­nently as the first item, but un­der­neath is the same lay­out as a blog post.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/art_detail_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Detail page for a
spe­cific page. Note the un­ap­peal­ing back­ground color.</figcaption>
</figure><p>This is prob­a­bly the least pol­ished part of the site. Some con­cerns I have about
the de­tails page is how the col­ors might clash. The cur­rent color is far from
neu­tral.</p><h3>Blog</h3><p>I wanted to keep the blog as a sep­a­rate en­tity from the rest of the site. This
informed some of my de­ci­sions, such as hav­ing the nav­i­ga­tion at the root of the
blog be a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>go to web­site” but­ton, in­stead of the nav bar as shown on the rest of
the site.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/blog_toc_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Table of Contents for
the blog. Probably page that changed the least from de­sign to de­vel­op­ment</figcaption>
</figure><p>The blog is mainly text-based, so I stuck to a black and white color scheme,
like ink on pa­per. I’m sat­is­fied with the very min­i­mal­ist aes­thetic.</p><p>I strug­gled more with the page of an ar­ti­cle. I had a cou­ple of choices to make.</p><ul>
<li>Typeface:
<ul>
<li>I planned on ini­tially us­ing two type­faces: Open Sans for head­ers, and a
serif type­face for body text. However, it looked kind of busy, so I
ultimately de­cided against it. I may re­visit the idea in the fu­ture,
though, be­cause I kind of like the look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cover photo:
<ul>
<li>I was un­sure of how I would han­dle cover im­ages. Initially, I planned on
mak­ing the cover im­ages fit into the width of the ar­ti­cle, but I ended up
pre­fer­ring the ex­pan­sive feel­ing of hav­ing the im­age stretch across the
en­tire width of the screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><figure class="figure">

    <figcaption class="img-caption">Mockup of a blog post</figcaption>
</figure><h3>Projects</h3><p>I prob­a­bly strug­gled with the Projects page the most. I tried 5 or 6 dif­fer­ent
card de­signs be­fore set­tling on one that I liked. I played around with work­ing
pro­ject-spe­cific col­ors into each card, but I fig­ured that would be too busy.</p><figure class="figure">

    <figcaption class="img-caption">So many vari­a­tions of the
card.</figcaption>
</figure><p>I added a sub­tle drop shadow just to keep things in­ter­est­ing.</p></section>
<section><h2>Post Mortem</h2><p>Overall, I’m very sat­is­fied with the de­sign of this site. Nonetheless, there are
still a cou­ple of things that I may change in the fu­ture.</p><ul>
<li>Art Detail Page
<ul>
<li>As I pre­vi­ously al­luded to, I’m not en­tirely sat­is­fied with the de­sign of
this page. I have two main con­cerns.</li>
<li>I’m not happy with the <strong>color choice</strong>. It looks kind of muddy, and does­n’t
re­ally al­low the pieces to stand out that much.</li>
<li>The <strong>pre­sen­ta­tion of ad­di­tional im­ages</strong> is flawed, es­pe­cially since some
im­ages don’t con­trast as well against the back­ground, and they’re
cur­rently very small with­out a way to zoom in on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Cards
<ul>
<li>I’m still not en­tirely sold on the de­sign of the pro­ject cards. I think the
<strong>pre­sen­ta­tion is a bit too plain</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blog Post
<ul>
<li><strong>Font color</strong> is some­thing I’m still work­ing on with the blog. The color of
links is harsh, and stands out too much. The pure black text on a pure
white back­ground also seems jar­ring. However, I like how sharp it feels
with that much con­trast.</li>
<li>The <strong>Table of Contents</strong> needs to be dealt with to make it more in­ter­est­ing,
or at least more vi­su­ally ap­peal­ing.</li>
</ul>
</li>

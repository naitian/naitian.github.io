    <h1 class="title">About this Site - Design</h1>
    <section><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>After getting an idea of what I wanted to accomplish with the site (which I
detailed in the previous post), I was ready to begin designing.</p></section>

<section><h2>Sketching</h2><p>I normally start out with sketching some ideas. Conveniently, I was going to
Seattle for winter break, so the hours on the flight sans internet was
well-used.</p><p>I find sketching to be useful for figuring out layout and the flow of content. I
was now ready to start making some mockups.</p></section>
<section><h2>Mockups</h2><p>I use <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/">Affinity Designer</a> for all of
my computer graphics work. I used to use Adobe Illustrator before I switched
computers, and the overall workflow is very similar, which meant a pretty low
learning curve for the transition.</p><h3>Home</h3><p>I started with the home page. I tried to keep it simple, and allow it to act as
a hub to all of the other pages.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/home_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">The index of the site</figcaption>
</figure><p>I also wanted to keep the terminal, and ultimately decided on adding a little
flip tab to reveal the "inside" of the site.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/home_unveiled_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">The hidden
terminal.</figcaption>
</figure><h3>About</h3><p>One of the first conditions for the About page was that I had to include a
picture of myself. However, images always raise the risk of disrupting the
stylistic consistency (especially when the photo isn't that good). I
eventually decided to add an overlay of the theme color.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/about_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Both the desktop and mobile
layouts</figcaption>
</figure><h3>Art</h3><p>A huge reason for the redesign of the site was because I wanted a place for me
to show off the things that I draw and design. This is where the design things
got interesting.</p><p>For the home page of the Art section, I wanted to keep it as a simple mosaic
layout, without any text. In fact, in the original design, I had envisioned
tiled and interlocking blocks. The goal was to have a wall of art, and clicking
on one would lead you to a page explaining the piece in greater detail.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/art_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Mockup for home page of art</figcaption>
</figure><p>This detail page was more interesting to work with. I wanted to cast attention
primarily upon the work, so I chose a dark background. The piece is displayed
prominently as the first item, but underneath is the same layout as a blog post.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/art_detail_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Detail page for a
specific page. Note the unappealing background color.</figcaption>
</figure><p>This is probably the least polished part of the site. Some concerns I have about
the details page is how the colors might clash. The current color is far from
neutral.</p><h3>Blog</h3><p>I wanted to keep the blog as a separate entity from the rest of the site. This
informed some of my decisions, such as having the navigation at the root of the
blog be a "go to website" button, instead of the nav bar as shown on the rest of
the site.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/blog_toc_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Table of Contents for
the blog. Probably page that changed the least from design to development</figcaption>
</figure><p>The blog is mainly text-based, so I stuck to a black and white color scheme,
like ink on paper. I'm satisfied with the very minimalist aesthetic.</p><p>I struggled more with the page of an article. I had a couple of choices to make.</p><ul>
<li>Typeface:
<ul>
<li>I planned on initially using two typefaces: Open Sans for headers, and a
serif typeface for body text. However, it looked kind of busy, so I
ultimately decided against it. I may revisit the idea in the future,
though, because I kind of like the look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cover photo:
<ul>
<li>I was unsure of how I would handle cover images. Initially, I planned on
making the cover images fit into the width of the article, but I ended up
preferring the expansive feeling of having the image stretch across the
entire width of the screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">Mockup of a blog post</figcaption>
</figure><h3>Projects</h3><p>I probably struggled with the Projects page the most. I tried 5 or 6 different
card designs before settling on one that I liked. I played around with working
project-specific colors into each card, but I figured that would be too busy.</p><figure class="figure">
    <img src="/assets/img/project_mock.png">
    <figcaption class="img-caption">So many variations of the
card.</figcaption>
</figure><p>I added a subtle drop shadow just to keep things interesting.</p></section>
<section><h2>Post Mortem</h2><p>Overall, I'm very satisfied with the design of this site. Nonetheless, there are
still a couple of things that I may change in the future.</p><ul>
<li>Art Detail Page
<ul>
<li>As I previously alluded to, I'm not entirely satisfied with the design of
this page. I have two main concerns.</li>
<li>I'm not happy with the <strong>color choice</strong>. It looks kind of muddy, and doesn't
really allow the pieces to stand out that much.</li>
<li>The <strong>presentation of additional images</strong> is flawed, especially since some
images don't contrast as well against the background, and they're
currently very small without a way to zoom in on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Cards
<ul>
<li>I'm still not entirely sold on the design of the project cards. I think the
<strong>presentation is a bit too plain</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blog Post
<ul>
<li><strong>Font color</strong> is something I'm still working on with the blog. The color of
links is harsh, and stands out too much. The pure black text on a pure
white background also seems jarring. However, I like how sharp it feels
with that much contrast.</li>
<li>The <strong>Table of Contents</strong> needs to be dealt with to make it more interesting,
or at least more visually appealing.</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <h1 class="title">purple.com: a brief eulogy</h1>
    <section><h2></h2><blockquote>
<p>On November 2, 2017, I lost a close companion. <a href="https://purple.com">purple.com</a> is no longer the bold-yet-understated purple eyesore that I had grown to know and love.</p>
<p>It has been replaced by <a href="https://purple.com">purple</a>, a mattress company that I keep getting ads for on Facebook.</p>
<p>In a token of remembrance, here is the story of my life with purple.com.</p>
</blockquote><p>I first came across purple.com in the summer of 2015. I had finished my first year of high school, blissfully unaware that school could get much much worse, and I had been to my first hackathon, <a href="https://hacktj.org">HackTJ</a>, where I built something incredibly broken, but with which I was satisfied nonetheless. I was hooked on hackathons.</p><p>I only mention this because I encountered purple.com at my second hackathon ever. The internet was, as it usually does when a couple hundred people try to access it at once, slow and unreliable. I sat with a couple of my friends, annoyed and impatient. One of them, who was more acquaintance than friend at the time, let out a cry.</p><blockquote>
<p>Guys, I have internet!</p>
</blockquote><p>I looked at her screen. It was filled with a disgusting shade of purple.</p><p><em>What the fuck is that.</em></p><p>"It's purple.com," she informed us. "It's the fastest loading webpage in the world."</p><p>That was a bold claim - one that I'm pretty sure is not true - but I took her word for it, and ever since, purple.com has been a constant in my life.</p><p>purple.com has been around since August of 1994. That's over five years before I was born. When I learned about purple.com, it could legally drink alcohol. It's not just a website. It's an institution - one that has been replaced by a mattress company.</p><p>As I navigated my way through high school, purple.com has always been there for me.</p><p>At every hackathon, when the internet inevitably goes awry, the blinding purple is the bearer of good news: <em>You can google things now</em>.</p><p>Every time I was frantically trying to connect to school WiFi so I could print that paper due next period, that luscious #DD00FF was there to reassure me: <em>Everything is okay. Your paper is horribly written, but at least you can print it out.</em></p><p>And all of the late nights spent <del>working</del> procrastinating, when I've exhausted Facebook and Reddit and Youtube, and even my email, my muscle memory would turn to purple.com, and the really quite horrid purple would issue its stern admonishment: <em>Get back to work.</em></p><p>But several weeks ago, that all changed.</p><p>I was having network connectivity problems. Unfazed, I opened my browser and navigated to my home away from home. And I watched the loading indicator spin.</p><p>That's okay, the network is still broken.</p><p>Then Google loaded.</p><p>Then Facebook, then Blackboard, then fcps.edu.</p><p>And purple.com just sat spinning.</p><p>I refused to lose faith.</p><p><em>It's an old site, probably the server had to be replaced or something. It'll be back up soon.</em></p><p>I held on to hope against hope that, the next day, everything would be back to normal.</p><p>I wanted to believe, but, alas, all good things must come to an end.</p><figure class="figure">

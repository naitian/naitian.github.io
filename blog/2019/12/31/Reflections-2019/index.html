<section><h2>Highlights</h2><p>If last year was a year of dras­tic change, this year was one of set­tling into
the flow of things.</p><p>In <strong>January</strong>, I saw Miss Saigon at the Kennedy Center (starring Emily Bautista
as Kim). This was the first of three mu­si­cals I had the op­por­tu­nity to see at
the Kennedy Center this year. Our seats were amaz­ing, and the Kennedy Center is
re­ally beau­ti­ful at night (and all the rest of the time too). I also did a lot
of math.</p><p><strong>February</strong> was a <em>lot</em> more math home­work (it kind of took over my life), but
with one event­ful uh&hellip; event. As I men­tioned above, I wrote up a fun joke pa­per
an­a­lyz­ing lan­guage use of the sub­tle asian dat­ing Facebook group, and it was met
with lots of pos­i­tive feed­back (and I’m now eval­u­at­ing whether I have too much
time on my hands).</p><p>We had our spring break in <strong>March</strong>, and that ap­par­ently still means col­lege
vis­its even a year into col­lege. First I went to <span class="small-caps">UVA</span> for HooHacks and to catch
up with some friends from high school (the whole thing was kind of a TJ
reunion). Then I met up with my U-M squad to drive up to Toronto, where we had
Japan­ese-Mex­i­can fu­sion tacos, ex­or­bi­tant amounts of bub­ble tea, en­joyed
Cana­dian Netflix, and ate dumplings with my friend at U of Toronto.</p><p>In <strong>April</strong>, <a href="https://blueprintlm.com">Blueprint</a> pub­lished its 8th is­sue
fea­tur­ing my good friend Xindi’s art on the cover! Also played in the spring
band con­cert, at­tended my first Michigan <span class="small-caps">MT</span> per­for­mance (Sweeney Todd), and
fin­ished up fresh­man year of col­lege with Coco bub­ble tea and in­stant hot­pot.</p><p><strong>May</strong> was a month at my new home in Michigan. It was also my new home be­cause
I got nat­u­ral­ized! Other note­wor­thy events in­cluded my car get­ting towed (it’s a
long story) and at­tend­ing the Dog Bowl in Frankenmuth, <span class="small-caps">MI</span>!</p><p><strong>June</strong> marked the be­gin­ning of my sec­ond sum­mer at Capital One. I worked on a
hackathon pro­ject which de­tected when you scrolled past a cat pic­ture and
sug­gested a do­na­tion to your lo­cal pet char­ity based on how many cat pic­tures
you’ve seen. Also hiked the Billy Goat trail and met up with some friends from
high school.</p><p>In <strong>July</strong>, I cel­e­brated my first fourth of July as an American, and watched
the <span class="small-caps">DC</span> fire­works from my apart­ment in Pentagon City. The day af­ter, I went to
the archives to see Constitution and Declaration of Independence in per­son for
the first time. Also went to the Lawn at the National Building Museum,
celebrated the 50th an­niver­sary of the moon land­ing, and got a <span class="small-caps">DC</span> li­brary card.
Last but not least, I saw The Band’s Visit at the Kennedy Center, and that might
have been the high­light of this year. We had amaz­ing tick­ets in the cen­ter of
the or­ches­tra sec­tion, and the en­tire mu­si­cal was just so beau­ti­fully well
crafted. Highly rec­om­mend.</p><p><strong>August</strong> was equally busy. It started with a visit to the White House (cool,
but hon­estly un­der­whelm­ing) and farewells to my team and friends at Capital One.
Then Dear Evan Hansen at the Kennedy Center (set de­sign was amaz­ing), see­ing the
sun­rise in <span class="small-caps">DC</span>, and cel­e­brat­ing <a href="http://davidzhao.me/">David’s</a> 20th birth­day
be­fore de­part­ing on my trav­els.</p><p><strong>August Travels</strong>: First on the itin­er­ary was Santa Monica where I spent my 12
hour lay­over at <span class="small-caps">LAX</span>. After see­ing <em>The Farewell</em>, eat­ing Street Noods, and
watch­ing a west coast sun­set, I took off for Chengdu. In China, I vis­ited
fam­ily, friends, and ate lots of food (the ex­is­tence of <span class="small-caps">AYCE</span> per­sonal hot­pot
makes me be­lieve in a higher power). I only spent a cou­ple of days in Chengdu
before head­ing off to Melbourne, Australia where I met up with my friend Jacob.
We spent over a week in Australia, where we ex­pe­ri­enced Melbourne’s White Night,
the Twelve Apostles, friendly birds, and de­li­cious food. We also snuck into an
Aus­tralian Costco, hiked the Blue Mountains (where we met an in­ter­na­tional
stu­dent from Thailand / Virginia!), ex­plored Sydney, ate emu / kan­ga­roo pizza,
and watched West Side Story at <em>the</em> Sydney Opera House! Pad that out with
platypi, Nepalese dumplings, and some more hik­ing, and we’re at September.</p><p><strong>September</strong> was the start of sopho­more year and my first year liv­ing in our
house off cam­pus. Also the first <span class="small-caps">MDST</span> meet­ing in my new role as <span class="small-caps">VP</span> of Projects
(in other news, lots and lots of meet­ings and plan­ning for the <span class="small-caps">MIDAS</span> Data
Challenge).</p><p>In <strong>October</strong>, we kicked off the <span class="small-caps">MIDAS</span> Data Challenge and had hot­pot at
Xindi’s.</p><p>In <strong>November</strong>, we wrapped up the Data Challenge, I turned 20 (!!), and I
played Dem Debate Bingo. I also tried quince for the first time.</p><p><strong>December</strong> was wrap­ping up the fall se­mes­ter and wrap­ping up this se­mes­ter’s
<a href="https://www.mdst.club/projects/rateme/rateme-writeup"><span class="small-caps">MDST</span> pro­ject</a>. Then I
traveled around California with my fam­ily, saw lights in Georgetown with
friends, and went to go see the Space Shuttle Discovery at the Udvar-Hazy Center.</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>Now that we’re head­ing into 2020, I guess it might be a good idea to look at not
just the past year, but the past decade. A lot has hap­pened in these 10 years.</p><p>In 2010, my fam­ily had just bought our first house. We bought an­other car. We
received our green cards. After so many years of un­cer­tainty, wor­ry­ing about
visas, liv­ing in apart­ments, it felt like things were fi­nally set­tling down.
Lit­tle did I know, the next decade&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the next half of my life&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;would see me
mov­ing far­ther, liv­ing in more apart­ments, and grow­ing much much more than I
could have ever imag­ined (seriously, who could’ve guessed I’d be over six feet
tall).</p><p>I lived in our house for all of 3 years be­fore mov­ing to an apart­ment to­tally
for­eign city a few hun­dred miles away. Since 2010, I’ve lived in more than six
dif­fer­ent zip codes, I’ve got­ten dri­vers li­censes in two states, and I have like
5 dif­fer­ent li­brary cards. I moved from a mid­dle school where my bi­ol­ogy teacher was
hes­i­tant to teach evo­lu­tion to one of the best high schools in the na­tion. I’ve
learned so much about life, about my­self, about love, and about lin­ear al­ge­bra
(in no par­tic­u­lar or­der). And I know I have so much more to learn and ex­pe­ri­ence
in the next decade, and hope­fully many more af­ter that.</p><p>Maybe one im­por­tant les­son I’ve learned, as I step back and look at these past
10 years from a thou­sand-mile-high van­tage point, is that you should never
set­tle. My dad took a huge risk when he de­cided to en­ter res­i­dency. My mom took
a huge risk when she de­cided to move the two of us to Virginia. We had a house,
two cars, and neigh­bors with a dog. We had a free pass to stay in the coun­try.
Ac­cord­ing to every­thing I’ve read, that sounds a lot like the American Dream™.
But some­times we yearn for some­thing more, and that re­quires tak­ing risks and
jump­ing in with­out know­ing ex­actly where we’ll land. It re­quires courage,
courage I’m glad my par­ents had, and courage I hope to in­herit as I take my
first steps into adult­hood and the pur­suit of my own goals and am­bi­tions in 2020.</p></section>

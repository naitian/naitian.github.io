    <h1 class="title">How to ask ques­tions at grad vis­its</h1>
    <section><h2></h2><p>Grad school visit days are an op­por­tu­nity to learn more about your po­ten­tial
ad­vi­sor and school. You’ll need to make some tough de­ci­sions in the near fu­ture
about where to at­tend, and you’re go­ing to want as much data to make this
de­ci­sion as pos­si­ble.</p><p>This past se­mes­ter, I took a qual­i­ta­tive meth­ods class<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">A fas­ci­nat­ing course, be­cause I come from a very quan­ti­ta­tive back­ground.</span>, where we learned about
con­duct­ing in­ter­views. Here are a few tips from that course which I wish I’d
known when I was talk­ing to pro­fes­sors and grad stu­dents<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">These are just tips for get­ting bet­ter in­for­ma­tion, but don’t stress out about fol­low­ing these to the tee (or even fol­low­ing them at all)!</span>.</p></section>
<section><h2>Interview Strategies</h2><p>You want to know what your life will be like at school X work­ing with pro­fes­sor
Y for the next four to six years. How do you get that data? In this case, you
ask oth­ers about their ex­pe­ri­ences, and use that to in­form your men­tal model.</p><p>But ques­tion-ask­ing is a lossy in­for­ma­tion trans­fer. People fre­quently for­get
to men­tion things, make am­bigu­ous state­ments, or have trou­ble putting their
thoughts into words. It is your task to aid them in this process, so that the
in­for­ma­tion you re­ceive is a faith­ful in­ter­pre­ta­tion fo their ex­pe­ri­ence.</p></section>
<section><h2>1. Be pre­pared</h2><p>It’s best to have a rough plan go­ing in. Come up with a cou­ple of themes that
you want to cover and some ques­tions you want ask. When I was talk­ing to
cur­rent PhD stu­dents, I usu­ally asked about their ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with X
advisor, liv­ing in Y city, work­ing in Z uni­ver­sity. I would also ask them how
they de­cided where to at­tend <label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This last ques­tion usu­ally yielded in­sight­ful re­sponses.</span>.</p><p>Remember, though, that this is just a guide, and the na­ture of an in­ter­view is
or­ganic. So, it is best to have these ques­tions and themes at the back of your
mind as you have a <em>con­ver­sa­tion</em> with who­ever you are talk­ing to.</p></section>
<section><h2>2. Be spe­cific</h2><p>Sometimes it is tempt­ing to ask broad ques­tions, since it is hard to know what
spe­cific ques­tions to ask. This makes sense! After all, you have never done a
PhD (and pos­si­bly never even gone to grad school), so how would you know what
it is you want to find out?</p><p>However, broad ques­tions elicit broad an­swers, and vivid, de­tailed
an­swers are more use­ful for you.</p><p>So in­stead of ask­ing a ques­tion like</p><blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>What don’t you like about X University?”,</p>
</blockquote><p>try ask­ing some­thing more spe­cific like</p><blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>What are some lo­gis­ti­cal frus­tra­tions about be­ing at X?”.</p>
</blockquote><p>Or even bet­ter, ask about <em>spe­cific ex­pe­ri­ences</em>, like</p><blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Can you tell me about a re­cent time when you felt frus­trated by some lo­gis­tics at X?”</p>
</blockquote><p>In gen­eral, if you can ask about ex­pe­ri­ences, those will re­sult in the rich­est
de­scrip­tions, since peo­ple can draw on their mem­o­ries in­stead of try­ing to
gen­er­al­ize.</p></section>
<section><h2>3. Ask fol­low-ups</h2><p>Another way to get richer an­swers is to fol­low up on any­thing you find
am­bigu­ous, or that you’d like to learn more about. This may seem ob­vi­ous, but
for me, this is ac­tu­ally quite chal­leng­ing, be­cause you need to quickly
syn­the­size what they said and re­spond.</p><p>It might be help­ful to think of some likely fol­low-ups when prepar­ing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this
will also serve as prac­tice for com­ing up with fol­low-ups. You might also want
to note down what fol­low-up ques­tions you thought of in pre­vi­ous in­ter­views or
vis­its, so that you have them top of mind in the fu­ture.</p></section>
<section><h2>4. Be cre­ative</h2><p>Though meet­ing in a cof­fee-shop or on Zoom might be the eas­i­est, it might not
be the most ef­fec­tive set­ting. If you’re vis­it­ing on cam­pus, con­sider maybe
do­ing a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>walking in­ter­view” through cam­pus or meet­ing in the of­fice space. This
might trig­ger cer­tain mem­o­ries, ex­pe­ri­ences or anec­dotes that peo­ple may for­get
to men­tion oth­er­wise.</p></section>
<section><h2>5. Take notes</h2><p>Remember to re­mem­ber! It can be hard to have a con­ver­sa­tion while scrib­bling
down notes, so I rec­om­mend jot­ting down some thoughts af­ter the meet­ing
in­stead. It will still be fresh enough for you to re­mem­ber the im­por­tant
points, and this al­lows you en­gage more ac­tively in the con­ver­sa­tion in­stead of
try­ing to mul­ti­task.</p></section>
<section><h2>Concluding thoughts</h2><p>When I was go­ing around do­ing vis­its, I had a rough idea of the things I wanted
to know about, but the ques­tions I asked of­ten re­sulted in the same set of
gen­eral, sur­face-level an­swers.</p><p>Hopefully, with some of these tips, you can be bet­ter pre­pared to have deeper
con­ver­sa­tions that re­sult in more in­for­ma­tive an­swers. But don’t miss the
for­est for the trees! The im­por­tant thing is that you are meet­ing with peo­ple
and learn­ing about the cam­pus and sur­round­ings in a way that is com­fort­able for
<em>you</em>.</p><p>So if the strate­gies I’ve men­tioned pro­vide some help­ful guid­ance for you,
great! But if they seem awk­ward or dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment, don’t worry about
it. Just do what feels good for you.</p><p>I think in­ter­views and vis­its two of my fa­vorite parts of the ap­pli­ca­tion
process. I had some in­sight­ful and in­spir­ing con­ver­sa­tions. I hope you en­joy
this process as well. Good luck and have fun!</p></section>

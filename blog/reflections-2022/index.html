    <section><h2>New Year, New Me.</h2><p>I look for­ward to writ­ing these every year, be­cause time just flies by and I
don’t have much chance to take a step back and let life sink in. I am
par­tic­u­larly sa­vor­ing the op­por­tu­nity this year be­cause it has been an event­ful
one.</p></section>

<section><h2>This Year in Numbers</h2><p><strong>250</strong> Github con­tri­bu­tions (back on the de­cline, but that’s ok)</p><p><strong>700</strong> miles ran (including 1.5 marathons!)</p><p><strong>324</strong> New York Times daily cross­words com­pleted</p><p><strong>1</strong> mu­si­cal at­tended (<em>Jagged Little Pill</em> at the Golden Gate Theatre)</p><p><strong>1</strong> cap and gown <span class="small-caps">🎓</span></p></section>
<section><h2>Highlights</h2><p>This was the first <strong>January</strong> in 16 years that I did not have any classes. A
short-lived respite; my classes start again next Tuesday. I ran 79 miles and
got my first PhD pro­gram ac­cep­tances. Also found out about Wordle (what a
mo­ment that was.)</p><p><strong>February</strong>, though short, was also event­ful. I ran 79 miles, got my first
Covid booster, and trav­eled to Madison, <span class="small-caps">WI</span>. It is a neat city with pretty
build­ings, a cool art mu­seum, and a lake that you can walk on! Towards the end
of the month, I flew out to <span class="small-caps">LA</span> with some friends, which leads us into&hellip;</p><p><strong>March</strong> was the month of travel for me. I ran 106 miles, in­clud­ing my first
half marathon, and flew for prob­a­bly a few thou­sand more. It started out with
the <span class="small-caps">LA</span> trip; we went to Joshua Tree (who knew the desert could be so pretty),
Pomona (who knew a col­lege cam­pus could be so pretty), and the Academy Museum
of Motion Pictures (who knew Studio Ghibli films could be so pretty<label for="ghibli" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ghibli" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(A lot of peo­ple, ac­tu­ally)</span>).
March was also the month of grad school vis­its, so a week af­ter get­ting back
from Los Angeles, I flew out to Switzerland for the <span class="small-caps">EPFL</span> visit days (and for
Switzer­land). It was a re­ally great ex­pe­ri­ence, and the en­tire coun­try is so
pic­turesque. After Lausanne, I vis­ited Jungfraujoch and Zurich. The day af­ter
re­turn­ing from Zurich, I drove to Ithaca with my par­ents to visit Cornell. It
was gorges, and snowy, even by my Michigan stan­dards. Two days later, I flew
out to Berkeley, <span class="small-caps">CA</span>, which had nei­ther gorges nor snow, but did have some
beau­ti­ful sun­sets.</p><p>By com­par­i­son, <strong>April</strong> was a bit more re­laxed. I walked for grad­u­a­tion and
ran 148 miles.</p><p><strong>May</strong> was the same way, largely spent in Ann Arbor and at home, just tak­ing a
break and run­ning (for 157 miles). I did, how­ever, spend about a week im­mers­ing
my­self in Hayao Miyazaki’s di­rec­to­r­ial oeu­vre: I watched, in the fol­low­ing
or­der, <em>The Wind Rises</em>, <em>Lupin <span class="small-caps">III</span></em>, <em>Nausicaä</em>, <em>Laputa</em>, <em>Totoro</em>, <em>Porco
Rosso</em>, <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Spirited Away</em>, <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>, and
<em>Ponyo</em>. I had watched <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> a few months ear­lier, in <span class="small-caps">LA</span>.</p><p>In <strong>June</strong>, I went back­pack­ing for the first time, hik­ing around 20 miles in
two days. In the fu­ture, I will bring more camp ac­tiv­i­ties and spend less time
walk­ing. It was also the month of the Banff Marathon, which I had been train­ing
for the whole month. My par­ents and I flew up to Banff (absolutely stun­ning),
where we vis­ited Lake Louise, picked up my packet, and prayed for the rain to
go away. The race was a to­tally unique ex­pe­ri­ence; I saw sev­eral rams along the
route, and it was just breath­tak­ing the whole way through<label for="breath" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="breath" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Which, granted, is not idea for aer­o­bic ac­tiv­i­ties.</span>. After the
race, I limped all the way to Seattle, where I vis­ited some friends.</p><p>I of­fi­cially moved out of my room in Ann Arbor in <strong>July</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>August</strong>, I moved to California and started school. There’s a lot to say
about that, but I will leave it at that for now.</p><p><strong>September</strong> and <strong>October</strong> flew by. I got my California <span class="small-caps">ID</span>, my par­ents came
to visit, and I sub­mit­ted an­other <span class="small-caps">GRF</span> ap­pli­ca­tion (second times the charm??)</p><p>I saw <em>Jagged Little Pill</em> with Isabelle in <strong>November</strong>. We also went on a
hike in Marin (that lasted a bit longer than ex­pected&hellip;). I cel­e­brated my 23rd
birthday (oh my god) and went on strike. For Thanksgiving, I flew to Seattle to
visit some friends and we took a week­end trip to Portland (also a great city,
with a mas­sive book­store.) Michigan won The Game. I took the Amtrak back from
Seat­tle (unfortunately, most of the trip was in the dark) and con­tin­ued strike
ac­tion.</p><p>And fi­nally, in <strong>December</strong>, I came home for the first time since I left for
Cal­i­for­nia. I watched the World Cup fi­nals with my dad, who is a mas­sive fut­bol
fan. Now I am sit­ting on the couch, into the last week of break, won­der­ing
where all the time went.</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>I’ve had a harder time writ­ing this post than in pre­vi­ous years. Last year, I
wrote</p><blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m tem­porar­ily stuck look­ing ahead into a bright cloud of com­plete un­cer­tainty.”</p>
</blockquote><p>In many ways, much of that un­cer­tainty is gone. This time last year, I did­n’t
know where I would be liv­ing in a year. Now, I know where I will be for the
next five or six.</p><p>But, like a new pair of shoes, I have stepped into a new life in which I’m not
yet com­fort­able. There is the nag­ging rigid­ity of pre­formed ex­pec­ta­tions: the
pro­gram mile­stones I need to achieve, the ideas I had about what grad school
would be like, and what I thought my twen­ties would en­tail. At the same time,
it feels alien: mov­ing to a new place, adopt­ing a new habits. Right now it
feels like an awk­ward fit, not yet bro­ken in.</p><p>I have a pretty good idea now of what the next few years will be like&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;of
what I will be do­ing and where I will be. The Berkeley iSchool has a pretty
com­pre­hen­sive guide on the time­line to do a PhD. But in be­tween those
mile­stones will be thou­sands of ephemeral mo­ments (and a hand­ful of defin­ing
ones) that are en­tirely un­known to me, and it is those that I look for­ward to
the most. These mo­ments are the wrin­kles and creases and scratches of a
well-worn shoe that shape it snugly around my feet.</p><p>Breaking in a new pair of shoes can be frus­trat­ing and some­times painful. I am
not the most pa­tient per­son. I find my­self some­times yearn­ing for the
com­fort­able, lived-in, fa­mil­iar past. But I know that this feel­ing will
di­min­ish with time, as I set­tle into the rhythms of this new part of my life.
There’s no other way to break in a shoe than to just start walk­ing.</p><p>So happy new year. I guess I’ll get go­ing now.</p></section>

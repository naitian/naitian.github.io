    <section><h2>New Year, New Me.</h2><p>I look forward to writing these every year, because time just flies by and I
don't have much chance to take a step back and let life sink in. I am
particularly savoring the opportunity this year because it has been an eventful
one.</p></section>

<section><h2>This Year in Numbers</h2><p><strong>250</strong> Github contributions (back on the decline, but that's ok)</p><p><strong>700</strong> miles ran (including 1.5 marathons!)</p><p><strong>324</strong> New York Times daily crosswords completed</p><p><strong>1</strong> musical attended (<em>Jagged Little Pill</em> at the Golden Gate Theatre)</p><p><strong>1</strong> cap and gown ðŸŽ“</p></section>
<section><h2>Highlights</h2><p>This was the first <strong>January</strong> in 16 years that I did not have any classes. A
short-lived respite; my classes start again next Tuesday. I ran 79 miles and
got my first PhD program acceptances. Also found out about Wordle (what a
moment that was.)</p><p><strong>February</strong>, though short, was also eventful. I ran 79 miles, got my first
Covid booster, and traveled to Madison, WI. It is a neat city with pretty
buildings, a cool art museum, and a lake that you can walk on! Towards the end
of the month, I flew out to LA with some friends, which leads us into...</p><p><strong>March</strong> was the month of travel for me. I ran 106 miles, including my first
half marathon, and flew for probably a few thousand more. It started out with
the LA trip; we went to Joshua Tree (who knew the desert could be so pretty),
Pomona (who knew a college campus could be so pretty), and the Academy Museum
of Motion Pictures (who knew Studio Ghibli films could be so pretty<label for="ghibli" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="ghibli" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(A lot of people, actually)</span>).
March was also the month of grad school visits, so a week after getting back
from Los Angeles, I flew out to Switzerland for the EPFL visit days (and for
Switzerland). It was a really great experience, and the entire country is so
picturesque. After Lausanne, I visited Jungfraujoch and Zurich. The day after
returning from Zurich, I drove to Ithaca with my parents to visit Cornell. It
was gorges, and snowy, even by my Michigan standards. Two days later, I flew
out to Berkeley, CA, which had neither gorges nor snow, but did have some
beautiful sunsets.</p><p>By comparison, <strong>April</strong> was a bit more relaxed. I walked for graduation and
ran 148 miles.</p><p><strong>May</strong> was the same way, largely spent in Ann Arbor and at home, just taking a
break and running (for 157 miles). I did, however, spend about a week immersing
myself in Hayao Miyazaki's directorial oeuvre: I watched, in the following
order, <em>The Wind Rises</em>, <em>Lupin III</em>, <em>NausicaÃ¤</em>, <em>Laputa</em>, <em>Totoro</em>, <em>Porco
Rosso</em>, <em>Princess Mononoke</em>, <em>Spirited Away</em>, <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em>, and
<em>Ponyo</em>. I had watched <em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> a few months earlier, in LA.</p><p>In <strong>June</strong>, I went backpacking for the first time, hiking around 20 miles in
two days. In the future, I will bring more camp activities and spend less time
walking. It was also the month of the Banff Marathon, which I had been training
for the whole month. My parents and I flew up to Banff (absolutely stunning),
where we visited Lake Louise, picked up my packet, and prayed for the rain to
go away. The race was a totally unique experience; I saw several rams along the
route, and it was just breathtaking the whole way through<label for="breath" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="breath" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Which, granted, is not idea for aerobic activities.</span>. After the
race, I limped all the way to Seattle, where I visited some friends.</p><p>I officially moved out of my room in Ann Arbor in <strong>July</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>August</strong>, I moved to California and started school. There's a lot to say
about that, but I will leave it at that for now.</p><p><strong>September</strong> and <strong>October</strong> flew by. I got my California ID, my parents came
to visit, and I submitted another GRF application (second times the charm??)</p><p>I saw <em>Jagged Little Pill</em> with Isabelle in <strong>November</strong>. We also went on a
hike in Marin (that lasted a bit longer than expected...). I celebrated my 23rd
birthday (oh my god) and went on strike. For Thanksgiving, I flew to Seattle to
visit some friends and we took a weekend trip to Portland (also a great city,
with a massive bookstore.) Michigan won The Game. I took the Amtrak back from
Seattle (unfortunately, most of the trip was in the dark) and continued strike
action.</p><p>And finally, in <strong>December</strong>, I came home for the first time since I left for
California. I watched the World Cup finals with my dad, who is a massive futbol
fan. Now I am sitting on the couch, into the last week of break, wondering
where all the time went.</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>I've had a harder time writing this post than in previous years. Last year, I
wrote</p><blockquote>
<p>"I'm temporarily stuck looking ahead into a bright cloud of complete uncertainty."</p>
</blockquote><p>In many ways, much of that uncertainty is gone. This time last year, I didn't
know where I would be living in a year. Now, I know where I will be for the
next five or six.</p><p>But, like a new pair of shoes, I have stepped into a new life in which I'm not
yet comfortable. There is the nagging rigidity of preformed expectations: the
program milestones I need to achieve, the ideas I had about what grad school
would be like, and what I thought my twenties would entail. At the same time,
it feels alien: moving to a new place, adopting a new habits. Right now it
feels like an awkward fit, not yet broken in.</p><p>I have a pretty good idea now of what the next few years will be like -- of
what I will be doing and where I will be. The Berkeley iSchool has a pretty
comprehensive guide on the timeline to do a PhD. But in between those
milestones will be thousands of ephemeral moments (and a handful of defining
ones) that are entirely unknown to me, and it is those that I look forward to
the most. These moments are the wrinkles and creases and scratches of a
well-worn shoe that shape it snugly around my feet.</p><p>Breaking in a new pair of shoes can be frustrating and sometimes painful. I am
not the most patient person. I find myself sometimes yearning for the
comfortable, lived-in, familiar past. But I know that this feeling will
diminish with time, as I settle into the rhythms of this new part of my life.
There's no other way to break in a shoe than to just start walking.</p><p>So happy new year. I guess I'll get going now.</p></section>

<section><h2>Things That Have Happened At Some Point in 2018</h2><p>In <strong>January</strong>, I pub­lished an Alexa skill with my friend, went to a cou­ple of
track meets, and re­leased the Ion bus app. I also went to HoyaHacks at
George­town, where I made <a href="https://github.com/naitian/scout">Scout</a> with
<a href="https://github.com/davidbzhao">David</a>, and had a cou­ple of de­li­cious cup­cakes.</p><p>In <strong>February</strong>, I ate (and was sub­se­quently dis­ap­pointed by) a ki­wano melon. I
also stole the show as Banker Number Three in the <span class="small-caps">TJHSST</span> pro­duc­tion of <em>Mary
Poppins</em>. To top it all off, tjCSL achieved an con­sec­u­tive 7 days of up­time on
all ser­vices, which was un­for­tu­nately very ex­cit­ing for me.</p><p>In <strong>March</strong>, pro­duc­tion started ramp­ing up for <em>Threshold Litmag</em>, went on a
class trip to Washington, <span class="small-caps">DC</span>, where I got my Library of Congress li­brary card.
We also moved out of our apart­ment.</p><p>In <strong>April</strong>, I de­ployed Ion Signage 3 and went to Bitcamp, where my team used
<strong>ma­chine learn­ing&nbsp;:wow:</strong> and a Myo arm­band to de­ter­mine whether you were
hold­ing a can. Also did some more pole vault­ing, and went to Chicago, where I
experienced deep dish pizza for the first time.</p><p>In <strong>May</strong>, I wore a skirt. I also played at Chantilly Jazz Fest with the jazz
band, con­structed a gon­dola out of card­board, ex­e­cuted a flaw­less (read: heav­ily
flawed) prom ask­ing, and ran tech sup­port for tjS­TAR (also pre­sented my se­nior
re­search pro­ject at tjS­TAR). May turned out to be pretty event­ful.</p><p>In <strong>June</strong>, I went to prom, then grad­u­ated and took lots of pic­tures and said
lots of good­byes. Then I went to ori­en­ta­tion, at which I met my very first
col­lege friends. Then I came back to Virginia, moved into George Mason
University, then be­gan work­ing at Capital One! I also went to the National BBQ
Festival, in which the free sam­ples and free stuff make up for the price of
ad­mis­sions. The week af­ter, I saw the National Symphony Orchestra per­form.</p><p>In <strong>July</strong>, I went to the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>A Capitol Fourth”, ex­cept it was the dress
re­hearsal, so it was mostly sound checks and John Stamos for­get­ting his lines
(sick burn). Also checked out the National Building Museum and <em>fun­haus</em>, then
or­dered food at a Chinese restau­rant for the first time, com­plet­ing my
tran­si­tion into Asian Adulthood. Ooh! I also wit­nessed the af­ter­math of a
mi­cro­tor­nado, so that was cool, I guess.</p><p>In <strong>August</strong>, my team at <span class="small-caps">C1</span> moved into the newly con­structed head­quar­ters,
fea­tur­ing a hot choco­late ma­chine on every other floor and pricey yet de­li­cious
cafe­te­ria food. Then I flew to Detroit, then San Francisco (where I was stuck
for al­most 14 hours due to flight de­lays), then to Chengdu. I caught up with
fam­ily, friends, and an abun­dance of Uniqlo stores. I also flew a
(sim­u­lated) air­plane and man­aged not to crash, so that’s pretty ex­cit­ing,
too.</p><p>On <strong>September</strong> 1st, I moved into the University of Michigan. I took a pic­ture
in the Big House and then got rained on. In September, I also went to my first
Michi­gan foot­ball game, took a selfie with a he­li­copter, tra­versed the
in­ter­con­nected build­ings of North Campus, and saw the Philadelphia Orchestra.</p><p><strong>October</strong> in­volved a squishy moon in the <span class="small-caps">UMMA</span>, MHacks (!), HackHarvard (!!!),
and some re­ally beau­ti­ful sun­sets in Ann Arbor.</p><p><strong>November</strong> in­cluded one (1) fake mus­tache, many Welcome Wednesday Bagels,
first snow, see­ing Candide live (hilarious and won­der­ful), try­ing to climb into
the walls of Rackham Graduate Building, and head­ing back to Virginia for
Thanks­giv­ing.</p><p><strong>December</strong> was a last push to fin­ish out the se­mes­ter. I built a gin­ger­bread
house, dis­cov­ered this re­ally cool book­store in down­town Ann Arbor, turned on
the Christmas lights in the <span class="small-caps">CAEN</span> cave (where I work), and prac­ticed a lot
(rel­a­tively). I also had a Zingerman’s sand­wich for the first time, which means
I’m ba­si­cally an Ann Arbor na­tive now. After school ended, I flew back to China,
where I went to Guangzhou (saw a tomb and a huge li­brary), Chengdu (saw my
grand­par­ents, ate hot pot), Zhuhai (went to the beach, saw a huge clam-shaped
thing and a whale shark). I should clar­ify, the clam-shaped thing is a build­ing
(the opera house), and the whale shark was in an aquar­ium. I did not see those
things as I was walk­ing along the beach.</p><p>And so that brings us to now. This was a pretty cur­sory look at the past year,
and I guess there was­n’t much re­flect­ing go­ing on&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;mostly just re­mem­ber­ing
what the hell I did for an­other 525,600 min­utes.</p></section>
<section><h2>Reflections</h2><p>This past year was pretty busy, and there were a lot of firsts. I lived on my
own for the first time. I wore a grad­u­a­tion gown for the first time (hopefully
not the last). But there were also a lot of lasts&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a lot of farewells bade
(bid­den? bid­deth?).</p><p>This year was the start of a new era for me, one with greater in­de­pen­dence, with
more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, with new peo­ple to meet and new things to dis­cover. But
the start of a new era means the end of an old one, and as I think about not
just this past year, but the past 5 that I’ve spent in the state of Virginia, I
realize just how lucky I was to have the priv­i­lege of liv­ing there, of meet­ing
the great peo­ple that I did.</p><p>I’ve lived in a lot of places in my life&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the five years I’ve spent in
Vir­ginia is maybe the longest amount of time I’ve spent in one place; it’s
cer­tainly the span of time with the most sig­nif­i­cant changes and growth.</p><p>I’m not sure where I’m go­ing with this. I guess, as I ring in the New Year (in
about 50 min­utes), I can only hope that the next five years will be as
ful­fill­ing and in­ter­est­ing and fun as the past five. I hope that, just as I
found a home in Virginia, I’ll find a home in Michigan, and wher­ever life might
take me next.</p><p>And you know what?</p><p>I’m al­most cer­tain it will be.</p><p>Happy 2019!</p></section>
